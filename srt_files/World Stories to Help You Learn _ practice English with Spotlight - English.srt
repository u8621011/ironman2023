00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:09,720
Welcome to Spotlight. I’m Adam Navis.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
Spotlight uses a special 
English method of broadcasting.

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,440
It is easier for people to understand, 
no matter where in the world they live.

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
We begin today’s program with a story.

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
Kwesuka sukela - once upon a time - there lived 
a woman named Manzandaba and her husband Zenzele.

6
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,680
They lived in a traditional 
home in a small Zulu village.

7
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,880
At night they sat around their 
open fire with their many children.

8
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,880
“Mama” the children cried. 
"Sifuna izindaba! We want stories!

9
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,640
Tell us some stories, mother!”

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Manzandaba would think and think.

11
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
But she and Zenzele did not know any stories.

12
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,320
They asked their neighbors, but their 
neighbors did not know any stories.

13
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They listened to the wind.

14
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,120
But the wind did not know any stories.

15
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
There were no stories anywhere.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Can you imagine a world without stories?

17
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
This story we just began is a story 
from the Zulu people of Southern Africa.

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,840
It is a well-known imaginary story.

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,280
It tells how all stories began.

20
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,480
In the story, stories were 
a gift to a mother long ago.

21
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
Stories are important to 
every culture in the world.

22
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
They are a way to entertain us, teach us, preserve 
our culture, and to help us make good choices.

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Around the world, people celebrate 
the telling of stories on  

24
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
World Storytelling Day in the month of March.

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,920
So today, we will celebrate this day with you!

26
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
Today’s Spotlight is on stories.

27
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,960
First, we continue the story of Manzandaba.

28
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Manzandaba did not know any stories.

29
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,680
So, she kissed her husband and children 
goodbye and left her home to find some stories.

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Manzandaba decided to ask every animal 
she met if they knew any stories.

31
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
She asked each animal.

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Some were kind, but some were not kind at all.

33
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,480
Some of the animals lied to her and said 
they had stories they would not share.

34
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
Other animals tried to help her by giving advice.

35
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
But none of the animals had 
any stories for Manzandaba.

36
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
Finally, a big sea turtle offered to take 
Manzandaba to the Spirit People under the sea.

37
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,680
She held onto the turtle’s shell very tightly 
until she reached the very bottom of the ocean.

38
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,600
The Spirit People agreed to 
give Manzandaba stories if  

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
she would give them a picture 
of her home on the dry land.

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Manzandaba gave them the picture.

41
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
They gave her a large, beautiful shell.

42
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
They told her “Whenever you want a story,  

43
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,200
just hold this shell to your 
ear and you will have one!”

44
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,120
When Manzandaba returned to 
land, her children asked her:

45
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
“Sifuna izindaba! We want stories!

46
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Tell us some stories, mother!”

47
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Manzandaba sat down on the shore.

48
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
She held the shell to her ear, 
and she began: Kwesuka sukela...

49
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,920
And this is how stories began.

50
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
World Storytelling day is not just 
a celebration of good stories.

51
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It is a celebration of the art of storytelling.

52
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Throughout history there have 
been many famous storytellers.

53
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,360
William Shakespeare. Rabindranath 
Tagore. Aesop. Nasreddin Hodja.

54
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,320
These are all famous storytellers 
from around the world.

55
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
They make stories with interesting 
characters and wonderful events.

56
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
But some storytellers use stories to 
teach good advice or give a moral lesson.

57
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Even simple stories can have big lessons.

58
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Usually these stories are called fables.

59
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
This is the story of the Wise Old Man

60
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
In a village, there was a very old man.

61
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Every day, people came to the old man 
complaining about the same problems.

62
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,560
One day the old man told them a joke.

63
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Everyone laughed and laughed.

64
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,520
After a few minutes, the old 
man told them the joke again.

65
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
A few of the people smiled.

66
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
The old man told them the joke a third time.

67
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This time, no one laughed at all.

68
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
The old man told them: “You cannot 
laugh at the same joke over and over.

69
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
So, why are you always crying 
about the same problem?”

70
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,400
In this story, the wise old man 
tries to teach people a lesson.

71
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
Worrying and complaining 
cannot solve any problems.

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It will only waste your time and energy.

73
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
Our final story also has 
a moral meaning behind it.

74
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
It comes from Nigeria.

75
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
This is the story of The Two-Colored Coat.

76
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Two boys were great friends.

77
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They promised they would remain friends forever.

78
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
When they got older, they built 
their houses opposite each other.

79
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
A small path formed a border 
between their two farms.

80
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
One day a trickster came from the village.

81
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
He decided to play a trick on the friends.

82
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
He clothed himself in a two color coat.

83
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
One side of the coat was red.

84
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,040
And the other side was blue.

85
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
The trickster walked along the narrow 
path between the houses of the friends.

86
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,400
The two men were working opposite 
each other in their fields.

87
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
The trickster made noise as he passed.

88
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
He wanted to make sure each man 
looked up and saw him passing.

89
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,280
At the end of the day, one 
friend said to the other:

90
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,640
“Did you see that man today 
with his beautiful red coat?”

91
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
“Do you mean the blue coat?” The other replied.

92
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,920
“No. His coat was red.

93
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I saw the man clearly as he walked 
between us!” said the first.

94
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
“You are wrong!” said the other man.

95
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,880
“I saw it too. And it was blue!”

96
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
“I know what I saw!” said the 
first man. “The coat was red!”

97
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,960
“You do not know anything!” 
the second man replied angrily.

98
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
“It was blue!”

99
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
The two men argued over and over.

100
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
They insulted each other.

101
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
And then, they began beating each other!

102
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
The trickster returned.

103
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,760
He watched the two fighting men.

104
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,920
He listened to their 
shouts.“Our friendship is over!”

105
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
The trickster laughed. And he 
showed them his two-colored coat.

106
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,720
The men were angry! They shouted:

107
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,440
“We have lived side by side 
all our lives - like brothers!

108
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Now you have started a war between us!”

109
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
The trickster replied,

110
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,640
“Do not blame me for the fight.

111
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Both of you are wrong.

112
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
And both of you are right.

113
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
What each one saw was true.

114
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,360
You are fighting because you only looked 
at my coat from your own side of the path.

115
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
You did not think there was another 
way of looking at the situation.”

116
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Simple stories can have deep truths.

117
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
They can show us life in a different way.

118
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
They can teach us how to live.

119
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
They are one of the most ancient 
traditions surviving today.

120
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,080
Think about a story that you have learned from.

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Is it an old story or a new one? 
What is your favorite story?
