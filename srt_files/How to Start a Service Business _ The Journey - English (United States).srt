1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,140
- Welcome to The Journey.

2
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,090
Today we're gonna talk about how

3
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,210
to start your service business.

4
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:04,620
Let's go.

5
00:00:04,731 --> 00:00:05,731


6
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,389
Hey, I'm Emma, your GoDaddy Guide

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,010
and today I'm super excited to be joined

8
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,470
with my co-host Justin Nealey.

9
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,230
Hey Justin, what's up?

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,280
- What up?

11
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:23,113
How are you?

12
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:23,946
- What are we gonna talk about today?

13
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:24,779
Starting a service business?

14
00:00:24,612 --> 00:00:25,612
- Exactly.

15
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,730
We're talking about starting
your service business.

16
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,540
- I'm already dying to
know, where do you begin?

17
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,700
'Cause there's a lot of things
that I'm sure you have to do

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,700
but what's first and foremost?

19
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,380
- Right, and you have to take
that first step of really

20
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,900
figuring out what you want
you want your business to be.

21
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,150
Right?

22
00:00:43,292 --> 00:00:44,292
You can't just go, I want to
be a service-based business.

23
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,620
Well, what do you want to do?

24
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,810
If you want it to be something

25
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,240
that you're actually passionate about

26
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:49,899
because you're gonna
get a lot of the things

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,320
that you don't want to do

28
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,153
like the admin or just the run-around,

29
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:55,970
and if it's not something
you're really passionate about,

30
00:00:57,109 --> 00:00:58,109
it's not gonna last.

31
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,460
- I love the passion component.

32
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,250
To me, if you're doing something

33
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
that you're passionate about,

34
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,140
you're gonna give it your all, your 110%.

35
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,720
- Right, absolutely.

36
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:07,553
- You're gonna do the best work.

37
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,470
- Right, it's your why.

38
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,580
It's why you do what you do.

39
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,580
- Yeah, so what do you need?

40
00:01:11,118 --> 00:01:12,118
Where do you start?

41
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,660
- So probably step one,

42
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:15,290
just to make sure that you're productive,

43
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
is to buy a computer
if you don't have one.

44
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,600
If you watch this on a computer,

45
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,920
then just disregard this.

46
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Move on to step two but
that's gonna be step one.

47
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,619
- What about a smartphone though?

48
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,452
I feel like I do everything
on my smartphone.

49
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
- You can do a lot, absolutely,

50
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,440
but it's all about being productive.

51
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
You can flip to different tabs,

52
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,710
go to different screens,

53
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
do a bunch of stuff that
you potentially couldn't do,

54
00:01:36,557 --> 00:01:37,557
or if you have to go and type everything

55
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,590
out on a smartphone,

56
00:01:39,839 --> 00:01:40,839
it's gonna take you a lot
longer than on a computer.

57
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:42,989
It's good to have both though.

58
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,180
- That's a good point.

59
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:45,100
Okay, so you have a computer, got it.

60
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Then what's next?

61
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,119
I'm thinking social media

62
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,930
but that's just 'cause I'm
obsessed with it, domain,

63
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,920
where do you go from there?

64
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
- So probably the next
step is to figure out

65
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:57,957
what your name is and buy a domain name

66
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
and get your social media handles.

67
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,980
We've got a couple of videos
that we talked about really

68
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,060
diving into Instagram,
Twitter, and Facebook

69
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,030
in the links or descriptions below.

70
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,790
As soon as you have that
domain then you need a website.

71
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Social media is great

72
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,020
but you can't always control social media.

73
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,350
Do you remember Vine?

74
00:02:16,183 --> 00:02:17,183
- (laughs) Yeah.

75
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
- Yeah, it was a super popular platform.

76
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,290
Right?

77
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
- What happened to Vine?
- Everyone invested

78
00:02:21,993 --> 00:02:22,993
all their time and it's gone.

79
00:02:23,574 --> 00:02:24,574
So all those followers went with it.

80
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,170
And with your website,

81
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,350
it's there to help you generate
leads and you control it,

82
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,930
and it's there for as long as you want it.

83
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,580
And then you piggyback into social.

84
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,900
- Another thing,

85
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,733
I'm so just wrapped up
in the digital world--

86
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
- Absolutely.

87
00:02:41,193 --> 00:02:42,193
- But I was at a trade show recently,

88
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,330
walking the floor, networking,

89
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:45,950
and I forgot my business cards.

90
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,840
And it's easy to do

91
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,020
'cause I do so much in the digital world.

92
00:02:51,266 --> 00:02:52,266
- Right.

93
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:53,099
- But I got by but I just am curious

94
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
as a small business owner

95
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
and the local heroes listening in,

96
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,700
are business cards still
an important thing?

97
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,550
- Absolutely, it's absolutely relevant.

98
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
In fact, I got a business card today

99
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,590
and it blew my mind, the quality of it.

100
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,570
Right?

101
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Look at that.

102
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,630
Super cool.
- There's even a texture

103
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:11,575
with the font.
- It's something tactile

104
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,060
and if you're on the go,

105
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,970
sometimes you may not
remember the domain name

106
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,010
or the handle or things like that

107
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,470
but that business card is just something

108
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,110
to really make yourself stand out.

109
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Especially if you got a cool one like that

110
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:24,243
that's different.
- It's a cool one.

111
00:03:24,634 --> 00:03:25,634
- It helps you out.
- Did you want it back?

112
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,520
- I mean, I might.

113
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,368
(laughter)

114
00:03:28,201 --> 00:03:29,201
We'll get it later.

115
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,034
I didn't even notice you
put it in your pocket.

116
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:30,975
- Yeah, thanks.

117
00:03:31,323 --> 00:03:32,323
- Some place you can get business cards,

118
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,470
there's places like
moo.com that's pretty cool.

119
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
There's Vista Print,
they've been around forever.

120
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,110
We talk about Canva a lot.

121
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,050
You can create your own
business card on there.

122
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
They can print it off for you.

123
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,070
- What do you use?

124
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,330
- I use Canva 'cause I like to really

125
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
design every part of it

126
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
and there's a couple of templates

127
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,200
but to each their own.

128
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,180
- Now when it comes to
getting your actual work done,

129
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
I imagine you need to have what?

130
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,610
An office space, work space?

131
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:58,554
Space in your home?

132
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,070
- It's gonna vary, right?

133
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:00,903
- Is that important?

134
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:02,772
- It's somewhat important.

135
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:03,605
It depends on what type
of service you provide.

136
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,970
If you don't ever really
talk to someone face-to-face,

137
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:07,996
you don't need an office

138
00:04:08,636 --> 00:04:09,636
but if you want to be able
to have meetings with people,

139
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,870
things like that,

140
00:04:12,703 --> 00:04:13,703
you don't have to invest
in an office space.

141
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:17,210
There are a ton of just co-working spaces

142
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,670
popping up all over the country.

143
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Some are free, some are
freemiums, some are paid.

144
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,070
It just depends on what the budget is

145
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
but with those co-working spaces,

146
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,530
what I love about it is it's
not only a place to work

147
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,500
but it's a place to--

148
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,430
- Free coffee.

149
00:04:32,263 --> 00:04:33,263
- There's free coffee too.

150
00:04:33,404 --> 00:04:34,404
(laughter)

151
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:35,237
There's coffee and Kick Flips

152
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,070
but it's a great place to network.

153
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,710
And you get all these
like-minded people around you

154
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,950
that you can just piggyback ideas off of

155
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:41,770
or find just complimentary businesses.

156
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
That maybe I'm a web designer, right?

157
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,540
And you're working there and
you're a graphic designer.

158
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
You start sending me web design leads.

159
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,740
I start sending you graphic design leads

160
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
and your service just builds
and builds and builds.

161
00:04:53,156 --> 00:04:54,156
Or work at home.

162
00:04:53,989 --> 00:04:54,989
Have a little office space,
something that's just yours,

163
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
free of distractions.

164
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,380
I know I'm like a squirrel.

165
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:01,610
I just get distracted all day.

166
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,980
Just I'm working and
then Netflix will pop on

167
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,550
and my dog runs by and I get distracted

168
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,730
so what I like to do
is go to a coffee shop

169
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and drink coffee (laughs).

170
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
- I love the working at home.

171
00:05:14,185 --> 00:05:15,185
It's not for everybody but--

172
00:05:15,877 --> 00:05:16,877
- Not for everyone.

173
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,710
It is if you like to work in your PJs.

174
00:05:19,084 --> 00:05:20,084
- That's how I do my webinars.

175
00:05:21,044 --> 00:05:22,044
(laughter)

176
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,230
Okay, so one more question for you.

177
00:05:24,185 --> 00:05:25,185
- All right.

178
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:26,276
- How do you stay productive doing this?

179
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:29,375
- Oh, that's tough.

180
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,208
It really depends on the type

181
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
of service business you provide.

182
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,220
There's not one answer fits all

183
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
but I'll go over some of the
things that helps most people.

184
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,970
First off, you need some
type of productivity suite.

185
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,310
Most popular out there are Google Suite

186
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,490
with all their Google Docs,
Sheets, all that good stuff

187
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,740
and then Microsoft Office.

188
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,290
I would almost caution people to have,

189
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:51,010
basically get a second number.

190
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,670
And what I mean by that is not going

191
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,090
and getting another phone.

192
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,310
Right?

193
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
There's lots of digital services

194
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
where you can basically have
another number on your phone

195
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
so that way people aren't
calling you on your mobile line

196
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,880
and you're like is this personal?

197
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,070
Is this business?

198
00:06:04,903 --> 00:06:05,903
And then it gets confusing.

199
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,780
- Separate the two.

200
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,730
- Absolutely, and then you
don't answer like a weirdo

201
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
like hey this is Nealey's Web Design

202
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,540
and it's your mom, right?

203
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,430
You want to make it professional

204
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,610
so you have that difference.

205
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:17,443
- She'll be happy to hear
that you're always working

206
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:18,687
and working hard (laughs).

207
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,750
- She's so proud.

208
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
(laughter)

209
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,790
And just separate your personal
life from your business

210
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,110
'cause otherwise it's gonna
start getting overwhelming.

211
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,610
- I say the same for social media.

212
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,140
If you have a business, go
and get a business page.

213
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,390
Don't use your personal page.

214
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:31,714
Yeah.
- Absolutely.

215
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,633
All right and then, let's
talk about getting paid.

216
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
You're a service business, right?

217
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,110
- Oh right, yeah.
- You want to get paid.

218
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:38,990
You're not doing this--
- That's an important

219
00:06:39,617 --> 00:06:40,617
part of all this.
- This is not just a hobby.

220
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:41,629
- Not just a hobby.

221
00:06:41,597 --> 00:06:42,597
- We all got bills.

222
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,579
- Yeah, passion that pays.

223
00:06:43,412 --> 00:06:44,412
- Yes, lots of tools out there.

224
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:46,008
If you're going in person,

225
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,610
probably Square or something like that

226
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,130
so you got that little dongle

227
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,230
and you can swipe that credit card.

228
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:52,770
Venmo's probably my favorite,

229
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,100
just to read the comments
personally that people talk about,

230
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,770
but quick and easy way to get paid

231
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:58,304
otherwise there's PayPal and Stripe

232
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,150
for your website and things like that.

233
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:01,870
- Sounds like a lot of options.

234
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
- We got options.

235
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,298
- All right, that's a wrap.

236
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,900
I want to thank my co-host,
Justin, for being here.

237
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,330
- It's been awesome.

238
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,410
- You're the expert and we learned a lot

239
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,190
about how to start your service business

240
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,080
but I'm sure you have questions

241
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:13,913

- Bye.
