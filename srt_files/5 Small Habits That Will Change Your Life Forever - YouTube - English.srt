(bell dings)

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,800
- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,

4
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,670
and welcome back to another video.

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:09,760
Thank you so much for being here.

6
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,470
With your help and support,

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,870
we're able to succeed in our
mission to make mental health

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,260
and psychology more
accessible to everyone.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,690
So, thanks again.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Now let's get into it.

11
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,130
Are you feeling a little lost in life?

12
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,530
Are things feeling stagnant and unmoving,

13
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:26,720
like you're not progressing
towards any of your life goals?

14
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:30,020
Do you feel like you're just
repeating the same routine

15
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,090
day after day with nothing to show for it?

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,080
Nowadays life is primarily centered

17
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,850
around working a good
ol' nine-to-five job,

18
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,420
or if you're still in school,
studies and assignments.

19
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,100
And this takes up so much of your time

20
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,190
so it's perfectly normal
to feel like you're stuck,

21
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:47,990
and that's okay.

22
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,460
The important part is to take action

23
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:51,380
whenever you feel like things
aren't going the right way

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,580
or when they're not going anywhere at all.

25
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:57,270
So here are five small
habits that have the power

26
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,640
to change your life around.

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
Number one, write down three things

28
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:04,990
that you're grateful for.

29
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,740
Has something ever happened
that was really important?

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:09,700
And you wanted to remember it

31
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,490
but then you didn't write it down,

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,750
then so you wound up
completely forgetting about it.

33
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:16,597
And you simply can't rely on your memory

34
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:18,750
to store every important
aspect and moment of your life.

35
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,330
Time passes and you might forget about

36
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,190
some of the important things

37
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,590
or the things to be grateful for.

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,780
Writing down things

39
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,790
you're grateful for will
help you foster gratitude

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
and allows you to think back

41
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
on what's happened in your life.

42
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,130
Helping to shift your perspective.

43
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,520
Studies show that fostering gratitude

44
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
will help you sleep better at night,

45
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,900
lower your stress levels,

46
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,570
and improve your
interpersonal relationships.

47
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,570
Taking up the habit of
writing down three things

48
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,430
you're grateful for in a gratitude journal

49
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:49,610
will create nothing but
positive change in your life.

50
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Number two, clean for 10 minutes each day.

51
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:56,970
Have you ever felt
overwhelmed with the thought

52
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:58,730
of cleaning your apartment or your room

53
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,410
because of how much
time it's going to take?

54
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,250
Well, to avoid feeling overwhelmed,

55
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,750
it's best to break down your
tasks into smaller portions

56
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:08,970
in order to make it feel
more manageable and doable.

57
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,950
10 minutes is a reasonable amount of time

58
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,970
to devote to cleaning.

59
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
It inspires confidence that you can do it.

60
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,850
And it's also enough time for you

61
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,250
to get something small done.

62
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:21,090
Try folding and hanging your clothes first

63
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,430
and then moving on and coming
back to your room to sweep

64
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,820
or vacuum for 10 minutes.

65
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:27,950
If your apartment just feels
too big to clean all at once,

66
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
try and start with one room at a time,

67
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,020
like in the kitchen doing dishes

68
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:34,670
or in the living room to
straighten up the couch.

69
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,190
If you can get something
small done in 10 minutes,

70
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,620
you'll be that much closer
to getting everything done

71
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
in a timely fashion.

72
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
Number three, take care of your skin.

73
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
Does your confidence take a hit

74
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,570
whenever you're upset about
your dry skin in the winter

75
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,150
or have a bad breakout?

76
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,260
Believe it or not,

77
00:02:52,093 --> 00:02:53,093
the way your skin looks can be

78
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:54,650
directly related to how
you're feeling and vice versa.

79
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,350
According to dermatologist

80
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,610
and clinical psychologist
Richard G. Fried,

81
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,250
inflamed skin, thinning hair,

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
and brittle nails can be
physical manifestations

83
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,820
of your mental state.

84
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,710
These unwanted physical changes
can have a negative impact

85
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,960
on how you feel.

86
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,460
This will further worsen
your skin, hair, and nails,

87
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,220
and create a vicious cycle.

88
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,210
This is one of the main reasons

89
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,430
why taking care of your
skin is so important

90
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,690
since it helps to foster
a strong emotional state

91
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,190
with high levels of confidence

92
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,670
and a strong and positive outlook on life.

93
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,470
Number four, implement
the 80/20 principle.

94
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,350
The 80/20 principle was
first observed in the 1800s

95
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:35,970
by an economist named Wilfredo Pareto.

96
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,970
He noted that 80% of the land
in his home country was owned

97
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,270
by 20% of the population.

98
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,360
This principle holds true
nearly 200 years later

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,480
and can even be applied
to different topics

100
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,350
such as business or athletics.

101
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,700
Are you wondering if this
principle can be applied

102
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,740
to your life and how?

103
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Well, it's been found that
80% of your success will come

104
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,760
from just 20% of your work.

105
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,300
This means that 80% of what
you do will be unimportant

106
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,180
or irrelevant to your success.

107
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
The main point of applying
the 80/20 principle

108
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:08,950
into your life is that you
identify that 20% of the things

109
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,550
that you do actually result in success.

110
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,310
A simple way of identifying the 20% is

111
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,010
by making a to-do list with
your most important tasks

112
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,550
at the top, and the least
important at the bottom.

113
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,490
Finally, cross out 80% of
your tasks from the bottom

114
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,790
so that you're only left with the top 20%.

115
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,440
By doing this, you will
improve your productivity

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,960
and efficiency by focusing all
of your efforts on the tasks

117
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,400
that will actually yield success.

118
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
Number five, implement
effective daily routines.

119
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Do you happen to wake up

120
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,690
in the morning feeling
tired and unmotivated?

121
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,830
This can be a telling sign

122
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,240
that your daily routines
are not working properly

123
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,700
or effectively for you.

124
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,310
Daily routines are broken
down into your morning routine

125
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,760
and your evening routine.

126
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,520
An effective morning routine
should stimulate your body

127
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,830
and mind while giving you a
boost of energy and inspiration.

128
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,420
Of course, everyone has a daily routine

129
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,430
that is unique to them,
so you'll need to find

130
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,980
what works best for you.

131
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,760
For the morning time, you
could read the morning news,

132
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,530
go out for an early jog,
or listen to a podcast

133
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:14,930
while you get ready for the day.

134
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,670
Now, let's talk about an
effective evening routine.

135
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
The main purpose of your
evening routine is to de-stress

136
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,010
your body and mind after a
long day of work or school,

137
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,940
while also gradually
preparing you for bed.

138
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,820
During this time, you should
do things that you enjoy

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,800
and engage in quiet hobbies
like reading, writing,

140
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
or watching a relaxing TV show.

141
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,430
If you're looking to change your life

142
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,050
by implementing these habits,
it's important to remember

143
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
that habits are difficult to build

144
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,860
and can take some time to
properly put into practice.

145
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,060
Focus on implementing them one by one

146
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,580
without rushing anything,
and you'll surely feel like

147
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
your daily life is slowly
turning in the right direction.
