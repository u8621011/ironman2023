00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:01,260

Thanks for being here.

12
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:20,636
How're you doing?

13
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,850
Like, how are you really doing?

14
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,190
In these trying times,

15
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,160
everyone is struggling with
something behind the scenes,

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,100
whether it be mental health difficulties,

17
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,990
financial problems,
relationship struggles,

18
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:32,060
or school issues.

19
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,680
Life can feel so difficult sometimes.

20
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,540
In perspective, life is really short

21
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:40,410
considering we spend about 26 years

22
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:42,330
of our entire life sleeping.

23
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,070
So how do we make the most of life

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,030
knowing the uncertainties?

25
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
You have to ask yourself,

26
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
what does it mean to live a full life

27
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,990
and how can I achieve this?

28
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,990
Here are eight habits that can help you

29
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,860
live your best life.

30
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:56,510
Number one, take care of
all aspects of your health.

31
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Do you eat a well-balanced diet?

32
00:01:01,610 --> 00:01:02,610
While maintaining all
aspects of your health

33
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,850
may seem tedious, in the long run,

34
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,070
you'll be happier and healthier.

35
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:08,990
Put in a little time and effort every day

36
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,670
to take a walk, eat some
fruits and vegetables

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
or take some self-care time

38
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
to help prevent dealing
with health problems

39
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,250
later on in life.

40
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
After all, prevention is much cheaper,

41
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,780
less stressful, and overall healthier

42
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,060
than trying to treat any symptoms.

43
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,170
Knowing this, try to get into
the habit of treating yourself

44
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
with the same love and care
you treat those you love with.

45
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,990
Number two, self-reflect.

46
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,110
Have you tried journaling before?

47
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:34,830
If so, how was it?

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
And did you enjoy it?

49
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,610
Many people don't like to journal

50
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:38,950
because it seems too time-consuming
or they feel pressured

51
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,940
to have the prettiest,
most expensive supplies.

52
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,220
However, what's really important

53
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,620
is taking the time for self-reflection.

54
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,970
Whether it be by jotting
down your thoughts

55
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,760
on a scrap of paper or
recording a voice memo.

56
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,470
Taking even five minutes
a day for self-reflection

57
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
can help you immensely.

58
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,670
It allows you to figure out your values,

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,640
what you truly like and dislike,

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
and learn from past experiences.

61
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,950
So try to figure out
what reflecting methods

62
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,010
work best for you and
be authentic about it.

63
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Number three, maintain social connections.

64
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,270
Do you make it a habit to
prioritize social connections?

65
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,380
While it's hard during a pandemic,

66
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,250
it's more important than ever.

67
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,180
Everyone needs a support system

68
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,890
no matter how independent
or introverted they may be.

69
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,210
Try to make it a habit to
maintain social connections

70
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,390
with friends and family,

71
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,840
even if it's simply a quick conversation

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
once every few weeks.

73
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
It'll help you lead a
balanced well-rounded life.

74
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,660
After all, your ups and
downs are meant to be shared

75
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
with people who love and care about you.

76
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Number four, focus.

77
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Have you ever tried to multitask?

78
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
While it's tempting to do so,

79
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,560
according to a study
by Stanford University,

80
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
multitasking is one of the
biggest myths out there.

81
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,880
In reality, your brain

82
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,150
cannot properly do two things at once.

83
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,460
Instead, it switches between them rapidly

84
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,520
giving the illusion of multitasking.

85
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
You'll end up taking
the same amount of time

86
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
or longer to do the tasks

87
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,250
with a significant decrease in quality.

88
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,710
This means you should
try to get in the habit

89
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
of focusing on one thing at a time.

90
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,390
If you're doing work,
shut off the television.

91
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,770
You'll likely end up doing
higher quality work faster.

92
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Once the work is done,

93
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,570
you can fully enjoy your show afterward.

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
Number five, live in the moment.

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,760
When something exciting happens

96
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,090
is your first instinct
to take your phone out

97
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,950
and snap a picture?

98
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,490
Many people claim they do this

99
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,750
so they can look back on
and remember fond memories.

100
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,770
However, which is really going
to bring you more enjoyment,

101
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,340
a photo or fully experiencing moments

102
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,740
with your friends and family?

103
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
In the end, your thoughts and emotions

104
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
are likely going to give you
more enjoyment and fulfillment

105
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
than trying to take a
photo for social media.

106
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,690
With this in mind,

107
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,730
try to put your phone away
and truly enjoy the people

108
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,150
and experiences you get to be a part of.

109
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Number six, manage your inner critic.

110
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Do you have a little voice
in the back of your head

111
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,440
telling you that you're not good enough,

112
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,660
you're gonna fail or you're
not attractive enough?

113
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
There is a lot of pressure to be flawless

114
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:03,810
because we see perfection

115
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
from social media around us everywhere.

116
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,570
This can lead to low self-esteem

117
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,220
and a constant feeling
of not being enough.

118
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,890
While it can be hard to fix

119
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,830
the root cause of low self-esteem,

120
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,510
you should try to recognize

121
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,710
when you're being too hard on yourself.

122
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,180
If you can get into the
preemptive habit of realizing

123
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,560
when your inner critic is
getting the best of you,

124
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,750
you can break the thought pattern.

125
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,740
Try to remember that no one is perfect

126
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,770
and that's what makes people
so uniquely beautiful.

127
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,760
Number seven, complain less.

128
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,840
What's the worst day you've ever had?

129
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
At the end of it, did you let it all out

130
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,660
and have an hour-long rant session

131
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,220
with a friend or family member?

132
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,170
Complaining can be stress-relieving,

133
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,870
but if it gets out of hand,

134
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,930
it can end up doing more harm than good.

135
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,770
For example, by complaining

136
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:48,930
about something you can't change,

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
you're giving it more
power to ruin your day.

138
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,570
Also, you're more likely to be resentful

139
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,750
and hold grudges against people
you may not even see again.

140
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,290
This extra burden can weigh you down

141
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,090
without you even realizing it.

142
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
Instead, try to let go of
things you cannot change,

143
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,810
especially past experiences
you didn't learn anything from.

144
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Remember that at the end of the day,

145
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,700
complaining too much
doesn't make you happier,

146
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:12,710
so why waste time on it.

147
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
And number eight, don't
be afraid to take action.

148
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,490
What's something that
you've always wanted to do?

149
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Many people are afraid to try new things,

150
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,410
whether it be fear of failure,

151
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,970
thinking it's already too late,

152
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,360
or not being able to find the time.

153
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,500
However, there really is no better time

154
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
to take action than the present.

155
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,110
You can't assume you
won't be good at something

156
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,170
unless you try.

157
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
And even if you want the best,

158
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,570
the most important thing is to
have fun and enjoy yourself.

159
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
It's never too late to try something new.

160
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
So try to make time to do something

161
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,530
you've always wanted to do.

162
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,650
Do you think you'll try to
implement some of these habits?

163
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,810
Even though we can't fully
control what happens to us,

164
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
we can at least have
positive growth mindsets.

165
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,180
If you try your best to
maintain healthy habits,

166
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,740
chances are you'll end up
living the best life you can.

167
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,310
And in the end, that's all we can do.

168
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,670
So you don't have to
worry about being perfect

169
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,580
or trying to control everything.

170
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,170
Doing your best is enough
and you are enough.

171
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,240
Do you think these habits
will help you in life?

172
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
If so, how and which ones?
