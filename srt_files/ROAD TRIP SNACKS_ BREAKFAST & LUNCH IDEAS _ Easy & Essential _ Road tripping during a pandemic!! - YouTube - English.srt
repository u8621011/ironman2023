1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:04,760
hey guys welcome back to my channel
so 2020 has been quite different for us

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,800
as we have been doing a lot more road
tripping day tripping

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,320
um than we have typically we hop on a
plane and we fly somewhere however 2020

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,640
has put a halt to most of our trips
because we've had four trips cancel now

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
and so we have had a lot of time at home
and that means we have been exploring

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
our beautiful state here of minnesota
and we officially just booked a road

7
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:30,439
trip we are heading back to our favorite park in

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:32,599
the u.s glacier national park

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,440
if you've never been there you need to
go you just you just need to go

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,879
now we have not been to all the national
parks in the u.s so we can't compare him

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
to all the parks but for all the parks
we have been to

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,360
that one is hands down our favorite park
we've ever been to so

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
it has been six years since we have been
there and we are so excited to get back

14
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:55,559
there we literally booked the trip two weeks

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,039
before we leave and so
we've been busy getting ready for our

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,800
road trip and so with that said i just
wanted to share with you

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,359
our road trip snacks and meals because
things are a little different this year

18
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,159
with the pandemic going on and since we
are traveling from minnesota to montana

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
um there's different restrictions for
the states and so

20
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,640
montana unfortunately still doesn't have
quite all their restaurants and stuff

21
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
open so we've had to kind of figure
things out a little differently this

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,600
year hotels we're staying in they won't
have any breakfasts available

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
and a lot of the restaurants are like
takeout only so we've had to modify

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
however i think we have a pretty down
pat on what we will be doing and i just

25
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:35,799
wanted to share with you some ideas
in case you were road tripping in 2020

26
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
or into the future and most of these
items are all gonna be

27
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
more breakfast and lunch related not
really dinner related just because we

28
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
are planning to eat out dinner most
evenings unless there's nothing open

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
then we might be going to the grocery
store to just try and find like a salad

30
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
or something with another thing that
we've really thought of when we were

31
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,520
purchasing the foods for this road trip
where we did not want to have to cook

32
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,040
like we don't want to cook any more than
we have to so we are staying in hotels

33
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,880
so we don't have like kitchenettes or
anything so we just needed

34
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:04,439
easy healthy meals and that's what these
are so

35
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
no cooking really involved you might
have to use the microwave but that's

36
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,440
about it so
let's get started all right so first i

37
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,599
want to go over items that will be
in the cooler on ice and something

38
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,879
that's really important to us when we
are

39
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,400
road tripping we do try to eat healthy
as much as we can however

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
we are human we do like our sweets
that's just how it is so we will have

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
some snacks that probably aren't the
best for us

42
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:27,959
however we are always looking for items
that are you know a good source of

43
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
protein
and fats and carbs you know get a good

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,200
balanced meals
so i think we did pretty good so let's

45
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
get started on the items that will be in
the cooler so as i mentioned because

46
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
we're in the middle of pandemic the
hotels are having to change a lot of

47
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,959
things and with that said
there aren't really any continental

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
breakfasts and that will all depend on
the state that you're actually going to

49
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,760
um but for montana there is none of that
going on so we will have to figure out

50
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
our breakfast on our own and
instead of going out for breakfast

51
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,959
because we like to get up really early
and get to the parks early

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
a lot of times the restaurants that do
have breakfast they don't open till

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
seven and then we're not in the park
till

54
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
eight or nine and that just ain't gonna
work for us we're early birds so one

55
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,080
thing we decided we are gonna hard boil a bunch

56
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,720
of eggs and that is a great source of
protein for breakfast

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
and they're super easy to carry and
snack on so hard-boiled eggs are

58
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,200
definitely top of our list
also we have lots of yogurt so we both

59
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,720
have our own yogurts that we like my
husband likes

60
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
uh this kind and they are greek yogurts
we do prefer greek yogurt over others

61
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440
they're great because they're
individually packaged

62
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,599
and they're easy to just bring on a road
trip another really easy breakfast item

63
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
are these pre-made breakfast burritos
and you just pop these in the microwave

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
now these are the egg cheese and black
bean so these are really great um there

65
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
are 230 calories and they have 10 grams of

66
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,959
protein in them these are really easy to carry in the

67
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,040
cooler and you just pop them in the
microwave and there's your breakfast

68
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,560
another really easy snack is cheese
sticks so we got a pack of cheese sticks

69
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,040
these are great sources of protein fats
and then my husband got some wisconsin

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
smoked string cheese he had to have that
so

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,480
okay so these are really good snacks to
easily carry next is carrots now i'm not

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
bringing this whole bag of carrots i
will be cutting these up and slicing

73
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
them into little carrot sticks however
we aren't quite ready to leave yet and i

74
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
don't want to do all that prep until
like right before we leave just so that

75
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
it's fresh and everything's ready
so they're not sitting so um carrot

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,600
sticks are awesome
it's a great little snack with like a

77
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
lunch and just a few other items that i
haven't picked up yet because like i

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,600
said i want everything to be as fresh as
possible right before we leave

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,800
is i will be getting some freshly sliced
deli meat that is how we always purchase

80
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
our lunch meat we get it fresh cut right
from the deli so

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
again i don't want to do that until like
the day before we leave and then i will

82
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,440
also get some lettuce for our sandwiches
as well as some cheese slices so

83
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,520
everything is fresh and ready to go
right before we leave for our trip i'm

84
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:51,880
sure you have seen a lot of our
sandwiches in my vlogs from our day

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,160
trips here in minnesota so yes that is
our plan for our road trip out to

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
glacier is having a lot of sandwiches for lunch

87
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
all right so now let's talk about dried
goods that don't have to be in a cooler

88
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,639
and they're easy to pack and easy to
bring with you hiking

89
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:14,919
first we have these rx bars now what i
love about these bars is that they have

90
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,039
tons and tons of different flavors
but they are literally the cleanest

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
ingredients you can get in a protein bar
literally all that's in these bars is

92
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,199
egg whites cashews almonds chocolate cocoa natural flavors

93
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,120
and sea salt that's it when you're looking

94
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,160
at other brands of
protein bars i mean they're packed with

95
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
so many different
things so these are literally the

96
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
cleanest protein bars i can find and
they are good so

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
these are great to just slip them in
your backpack if you're out hiking for

98
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,039
the day
so if you get hungry during your hikes

99
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
um you can just pull one out and snack
another snack that we love to have with

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
us and it's super easy to slip in your
backpack is

101
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,520
beef jerky so again this is a great
snack for when you're out hiking

102
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
if you get hungry just have some beef
jerky it's full of protein

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
and you're good to go we're bringing
some bread with us because as i

104
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
mentioned we do eat up sandwiches typically for

105
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,240
lunches when we are out road tripping or
day tripping

106
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,560
and if we get tired of sandwiches with
the meat the cheese

107
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
and the lettuce and we are gonna mix
things up and have

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
peanut butter and jelly so this is
actually great too for like breakfast if

109
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,600
you had a toaster in your room you could

110
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,360
make a piece of toast or something
otherwise peanut butter and jelly i mean

111
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
can't go wrong with that right another
really great find that

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
is the same brand as the rx bars is that
they have

113
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,280
rx oatmeal which i am so excited to find
this i haven't had any yet but i've

114
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
heard really good things about it these
little cups you just add water to them

115
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,919
and microwave them and the only
ingredients

116
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,919
in this little cup of oatmeal is oats
almonds dates egg whites apples natural

117
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,160
flavors and cinnamon so they do have a maple kind

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,520
and they have the apple cinnamon and they might have

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
had another flavor but i don't remember
they might have like a blueberry i can't

120
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:01,639
i might be wrong since these are really
easy to pop in our microwave

121
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
they're healthy and nutritious and we
can pair these with hard-boiled eggs if

122
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
we want or one of those breakfast burritos that

123
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
i just showed you and to go with those
breakfast burritos we had to bring some

124
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
cholula with because
all burritos must have cholula so we got

125
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,319
that little bottle and then some more
snappy items that we picked up

126
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,440
was a bag of this mountain trail mix it
has

127
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,639
peanuts raisins m m's chocolate almonds
and cashews so yes i did buy the kind

128
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,440
that had all the chocolate in it because
that's my favorite you can totally go

129
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
without those but i figured you know
what

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
it's okay we have a lot of hiking to do
i will work off all those m

131
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
ms i'm not worried about it we also
bought some sun chips just for like our

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
sandwiches again
a lot of our day trip videos you'll see

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
we're having sandwiches with chips so we
just bought some of these

134
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,360
for lunches and if you just saw in our
last vlog where we went to hike devil's

135
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,599
kettle and had lunch in grand portage
we had a war between chips ahoy and oreo

136
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
and so guess who won who won that little
debate which is better

137
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,360
that's right oreos it's a great way to
cure that little sweet tooth that i get

138
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,440
after meals and just a little bit of a healthier

139
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:08,599
snack are some apples so we're gonna
bring a little bag of apples too and

140
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,680
then we may
also pick up some bananas on the way out

141
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
there again i want them to be fresh
so i haven't picked any of those up yet

142
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,160
so this way we're still getting our
fruit in all right now let's talk about

143
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
drinks so staying hydrated when you're
out and about road tripping

144
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
and hiking and stuff for long periods of
time it is so important

145
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,639
so of course we are going to have lots
and lots of water with us

146
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,919
especially when we're in the park when
it's not as easy to go get water we have

147
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,919
to make sure we come prepared so we have a large

148
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
water jug that will be filled with water
and we also bring smaller ones for

149
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:44,680
in our backpack so we will have every
single water jug that we have with us

150
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
are going to be filled with water so we
stay hydrated during our time in the

151
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,519
park because we are going during a
pandemic a lot of the

152
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
nature stores and the restaurants and
all the things that are typically open

153
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,080
are not open so getting some of these
items is going to be harder so

154
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,519
that's why preparing for this trip has
been really important to us

155
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:05,959
it's not like we can just go pick some
up or something um

156
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
so we have to be prepared for this and
probably the second must

157
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
is my coffee nothing ruins a day more
than a bad cup of coffee

158
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,519
so yes our hotel in our room will have a
coffee maker however

159
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
how often do they really clean those i i
don't know it's always kind of gross me

160
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,880
out to use a coffee maker that is in a
room

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
that you know many people have used and
you don't really know how often they've

162
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,519
been cleaned so guess what we did for
this road trip

163
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
we went and bought ourselves this mini
five cup

164
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
coffee maker so we can bring it with us
and it is our coffee maker and we know

165
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
it's cleaned and good
and this is gonna be our little coffee

166
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,920
pot when we go so we can make
our coffee that we like i try to talk my

167
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,320
husband into bringing the espresso
machine but

168
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,399
he wasn't having that so that little
five cup coffee maker will do so we can

169
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:56,839
make our coffee this is what we drink
all the time we are caribou

170
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,360
fans and this is our coffee and then i
brought all my

171
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,279
little flavoring ingredients because i
love my mochas

172
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
this is not espresso so i can't make
them to the tea

173
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,079
of how i usually make them however i i
can handle it

174
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,920
i can do this i'm not worried about it
it's still gonna be good i got my

175
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
caribou coffee i got my sweeteners
my mocha stuff i'm good to go typically

176
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
with lunches we usually like to kind of
switch things up we do drink a lot of

177
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,600
water at lunch however i do
like to have a cola zivia typically for

178
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
lunch and so we are bringing a little
pack of these

179
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,120
and i don't know if these are going to
be items i can pick up

180
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
out there because they're not that easy
to get and then

181
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,480
same with my cop we are very picky
people with our coffee and

182
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
i don't know if we'll be able to get
this caribou coffee out in montana so

183
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
that's why we're bringing it with us
hubby is bringing a little case of beers

184
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,360
too for dinners lunches sitting down by
a lake or just

185
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,519
hanging out at our hotel or whatever he
just likes to have

186
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
a beer once in a while so he is bringing
this pack of indeed brewing company

187
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,920
which is from minneapolis
however when we do travel he loves

188
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
trying new beers from other states
but again i don't know how much of that

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
we're going to be doing because our plan
is to eat most of our dinners

190
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,279
out however it might be like takeout so
i don't know what the plan is with beer

191
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
so he's like well i'm just going to
stock up bring him with us we're road

192
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
tripping so and with that said i'm doing the same

193
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:27,839
thing i'm getting my wine bringing my
wine with me just in case

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,360
so one thing that this year has taught
us is that

195
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
at the end of the day if we went out for
dinner and go have drinks and stuff

196
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,079
that's really fun to do that but you
know what we have realized this year we

197
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
have loved bringing our own beers
our own wines and then just going to

198
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
like a park or to a beach or something and just

199
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,760
sitting down there and drinking our own
drinks because it's just more relaxing

200
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,399
than sitting in a bar and we just sit down on a beach and

201
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
watch the water or sit in a park or something we have

202
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
really really come to like that
so that's why i now pack these

203
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,079
mini wines and these are perfect for
just throwing into a cooler

204
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
and then bringing an insulated wine
glass

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
and then you can just fill up your wine
glass with these minis instead of

206
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
bringing a huge bottle but bring the big bottles so you can

207
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
fill the mini so we'll see how that
works

208
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,519
and to be honest it's probably saved us
a lot of money instead of going to buy a

209
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
nine dollar glass of wine
i think going to buy a ten dollar bottle

210
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
of wine and that was gonna last me a lot
longer

211
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
so one thing we have realized this year
it has been so fun to just go

212
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
down to parks with a pack lunch or
drinks and just sit there together and

213
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
not be in restaurants or bars to do that
trust us we still enjoy going out to eat

214
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
but it's been really fun to
have like the picnic thing this year

215
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
more than we have ever done so
i don't know i have a feeling we

216
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,760
actually might continue doing that
so if anything a little good did come

217
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:58,279
from this pandemic so i hope you found
this video interesting i hope it maybe
