00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:02,713
(spirited music)

2
00:00:05,499 --> 00:00:06,499
(spirited upbeat music)

3
00:00:22,344 --> 00:00:23,344
(spirited dramatic music)

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
- What's up, guys?

5
00:00:57,753 --> 00:00:58,753
In this video, I will give you five tips

6
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
on how you can shoot a travel video

7
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,110
with your iPhone.

8
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,020
I'm currently here in Hurghada, Egypt,

9
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,100
here on vacation,

10
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,550
and I thought it would be a great idea

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,160
to give you guys some tips

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,650
on how to shoot a travel video,

13
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,470
but still be able to enjoy the moment

14
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,630
while traveling.

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:14,570
The best part about
filming with a smartphone

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,760
is that you don't have to
bring a lot of gear with you

17
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:19,530
to create great-looking videos.

18
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,450
In fact, the less gear you bring with you,

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
the more creative you will have to be

20
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
when it comes to shooting your videos.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,250
For me, when I'm traveling,

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,600
I like to keep it mobile and lightweight.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,150
When it comes to capturing moments,

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,870
I want to be able to do that
quickly and efficiently.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
With that in mind, here are five tips

26
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,610
that will help you create
better travel videos.

27
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,120
Tip number one is to travel light.

28
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,980
Sometimes we think we have to bring a lot

29
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,830
of gear with us

30
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:44,663
to create the shots that we need.

31
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
Try to be creative

32
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and only bring the
necessary gear with you.

33
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,140
Try to challenge yourself

34
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,460
using the tools you have with you.

35
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,560
If you don't have a drone,

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,190
use a tripod, for example,

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,040
or anything that can bring
your camera high above ground

38
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
to create that fake drone shot.

39
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,630
Also, when traveling light,

40
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,160
you are able to capture
moments much quicker,

41
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
and makes the trip more enjoyable.

42
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620
Here are the tools I bring with me

43
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,490
whenever I travel.

44
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
Now, obviously the iPhone 13
Pro Max is always with me,

45
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:14,070
but what I additionally
bring is a smartphone gimbal

46
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,190
which is the DJI OM 4.

47
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,050
And what I like about it is

48
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,240
that it has a magnetic clamp

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
that allows me to go handheld

50
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,030
in a matter of seconds.

51
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,350
I also find it convenient
to use the DJI OM 4

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
as a power bank

53
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
since shooting videos can
drain the battery quickly.

54
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,430
And because you're on the go,

55
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,840
it is hard to find a place
to charge your phone.

56
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
Now, a lot of my shots are handheld,

57
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,320
but there's certainly also moments

58
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,950
where I prefer using a gimbal

59
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:41,690
to add more movement into my shots.

60
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,270
Now, the gimbal is also great
for capturing hyper-lapse

61
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,620
which I love to include
in my travel videos,

62
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
but also static shots

63
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
where I just place my
gimbal on a even surface

64
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,600
to create a time-lapse video.

65
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,710
Now, tip number two is to shoot handheld.

66
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,770
Like I've mentioned,

67
00:02:57,603 --> 00:02:58,603
most shots made during my travel videos

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,010
are shot handheld.

69
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
The travel video of Istanbul, Turkey

70
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,860
was shot 80% handheld.

71
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,250
For me, shooting handheld
is the quickest way

72
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
to capture moments.

73
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,060
To get the best handheld results,

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,040
shooting in a high-frame rate,

75
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,570
such as 60 frames-per-second,

76
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:15,840
to then slow it down in post,

77
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,700
which helps smoothen out the shots.

78
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,870
Additionally, I like to add
image stabilization in post

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
to get the best results possible.

80
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,810
As you can see, you don't
necessarily need a gimbal

81
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
to create dynamic looking shots.

82
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
If you need to create static shots,

83
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,750
such as a time-lapse,

84
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,060
instead of bringing a large tripod,

85
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
use a gimbal or a GorillaPod,

86
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,050
which is much smaller in size,

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,560
portable, and versatile to use

88
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
as you can wrap it around objects

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,360
like a pole or tree.

90
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
Tip number three is body posture.

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Whenever shooting handheld,

92
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
you want to keep your
arm close to your body

93
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,690
and create a two-point contact

94
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
as this will help smoothen out the shot.

95
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,910
You also want to walk heel to toe

96
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,470
to avoid up and down movements.

97
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,630
This way, you will make your shots

98
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
look much more natural.

99
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,410
When holding your phone,

100
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,470
try to hold it in a way

101
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
with one hand supporting
the bottom of the phone

102
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:06,970
and the other hand placed

103
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,330
towards the center of the phone.

104
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,390
You will notice that you'll
have much better grip

105
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,640
and can therefore control your
camera movements much better.

106
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,130
Depending on your shot,

107
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,420
this isn't always possible,

108
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:18,850
but whenever you can,

109
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
try to apply this method.

110
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,870
Also, while recording your videos,

111
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,440
try to hold your breath

112
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,020
as this will also help make
the shakes less apparent.

113
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Tip number four is to make sure
you get a variety of shots.

114
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
Try to shoot as many angles,

115
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:32,950
focal lengths and movements

116
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,500
as you can think of

117
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,810
to make your videos more interesting.

118
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,090
Include wide-angle shots
to establish the scene,

119
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,870
but also capture detailed shots

120
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,950
that are important for the story.

121
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,150
I often see people doing the mistake

122
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,870
of just capturing wide shots,

123
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
which can quickly get boring.

124
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:50,390
Shoot the scene from different angles

125
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
so that you can cut between the shots

126
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,930
to make the video more engaging.

127
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,070
The best travel videos are those

128
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,670
with many creative shots in it

129
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,620
that make you feel like you're there.

130
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Also, the more of a
variety of shots you have,

131
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,370
the easier it is for you

132
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,730
to piece the clips together in the edit.

133
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,070
Only around 10% of all the videos I shoot

134
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,800
when it comes to travel type videos,

135
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
end up in the edit

136
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:13,130
as I only take out the best portion

137
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
of the video.

138
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,340
As a rule of thumb,

139
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,330
shoot more than you need,

140
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,640
but also be purposeful with your shots

141
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:20,990
so that it fits with your edit.

142
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,880
This leads me to tip number five,

143
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,480
which is to shoot to edit.

144
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,210
The tendency most beginner filmmakers have

145
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
is to shoot everything they see

146
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,740
without giving much thought.

147
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,480
Before you start recording your video,

148
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,120
think about why you're shooting it

149
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,920
and how it fits the overall story

150
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,160
that you will be telling

151
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:39,470
when editing the video together.

152
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,170
A good idea is to do some pre-planning

153
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,420
to have a rough idea

154
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,710
of how you want the video to look like.

155
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,030
How do you want the people to feel

156
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
when they see your video?

157
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,350
And based on that vision
you have in your mind,

158
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:52,950
you can start shooting more purposefully.

159
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
What I like to do is to search

160
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
for the music beforehand

161
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,330
to get a good idea of how
the video should feel like.

162
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,170
Also when it comes to transitional shots,

163
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,140
having the edit in mind is very important.

164
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,770
Think about how you
should film the next shot

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,280
to match it with the previous shots.

166
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
This way, your videos
will have a better flow

167
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,750
and will make more sense in the edit.

168
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,870
So, a bonus tip I have for you guys

169
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
is to try to include a
subject in your video.

170
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
This will make your
videos more interesting

171
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
and you can really focus on a subject

172
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,410
that is doing something

173
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,550
and build a story out of it.

174
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,410
Now, there could be moments

175
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
where you're traveling alone,

176
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,650
so it's a good idea to
maybe ask the local people

177
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,710
if they would like to
be part of the video.

178
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,350
You will be surprised that a lot of people

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
would love to part of your video.

180
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
I, for example, love
to take portrait video

181
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,510
where the subject is standing still

182
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
looking directly into the camera

183
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:45,330
where I then create a slow-moving shot,

184
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:47,530
but it doesn't only have to be people.

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
What I like to do is also film birds

186
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,690
since they're also moving in a scene

187
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
and creates also a lot of interest.

188
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,180
Now, what's great about
filming the local people

189
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,550
is that they're always doing something,

190
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,180
and I usually like to capture
those moments as well.

191
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
So, don't be shy,

192
00:07:04,033 --> 00:07:05,033
just go over to them,

193
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,130
and ask them if you could film them.

194
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
That's where you will create
a whole lot of a better story.

195
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,870
So, make sure to keep these tips in mind

196
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
the next time you create a travel video

197
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,610
as this will make your
life a whole lot easier.
