1
00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:01,859
Let´s be honest, it´s not cool to feel left
out when your partner is speaking to the children

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:07,299
in a language that you don´t understand…yet.

3
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,010
I would say that that is one of the most common
reasons why multilingual families end up dropping

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,330
their minority languages, choosing often English
or the majority language to communicate within

5
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,990
the family instead.

6
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,670
That reminds me of the time when I was a child.

7
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:25,109
My mother used to ask my father to switch
to Spanish so she would be able to follow

8
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:30,109
the conversation.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,670
But my dad never gave in.

10
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:34,469
He was convinced that it was important to
stick to his strongest languages, Swiss German

11
00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:39,379
when speaking to us to grow up simultanously
bilingual and bicultural.

12
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,190
He was totally right.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,260
And as for my mom, it was hard at times for
her, mostly in the beginning, but she learned

14
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,890
eventually to speak and understand Swiss German.

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,030
That gave her over the years a bunch of lovely
experiences with our family in Switzerland

16
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,019
because thanks to that, she was integrated
when we paid them a visit.

17
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:08,690
And so, that made a massive difference in
our lives.

18
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:12,549
It raised our quality of life.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,950
Anyway, I´m just saying, it makes sense to
make some effort in the beginning to start

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,090
learning along with the children the partner´s
language.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,960
It pays off in life many times.

22
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:28,329
And that is why today I´m going to share
5 Tips for Learning Your Partner´s Language

23
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,890
Easily.

24
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:35,290
Maybe I can convince you to give your minority
languages a real chance to thrive in the next

25
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:40,899
generations.

26
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:41,899
Tip # 1
Don´t start with the basics, immerse yourself,

27
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:47,729
dive into the language head on.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Traditional language programs tell you to
start with the basics such as the alphabet,

29
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
numbers, and common phrases.

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
”Hello, my name is Pedro, I´m 35 years
old, I live in…”

31
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:04,329
Seriously, when in the world do we actually
say or want to say how old we are?

32
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Never.

33
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,980
I don´t know about you, but I find this approach
extremely boring und unmotivating.

34
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:17,490
I´m with Steve Kaufmann in this one.

35
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:19,959
He says: Don´t study the basics.

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,130
Dive into the read deal from day one.

37
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
That leads us to…

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Tip # 2
Be an active listener when your partner speaks

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
to the children.

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,390
Ask back when you hear a new word (and you
have the energy to do it).

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,240
Open yourself up to the language.

42
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,380
Allow yourself to be exposed to it without
pressuring yourself.

43
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,380
You know, even if you don´t do anything else,
you will start understanding the conversations

44
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
between your partner and your children.

45
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,780
I guarantee it.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,240
And that is what´s important: to be able
to understand and follow the conversations.

47
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,530
When you want to say something, you can always
reply in the language you usually speak to

48
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,390
your partner or children.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,540
You know I remember the last Danish Christmas
Party my husband and I went to last December

50
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,010
here in Zurich.

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,370
There was a young couple there.

52
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:15,799
I remember being very impressed about how
well they could speak each other’s languages

53
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,330
since they had just started learning them
after they had met and without formal training.

54
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
They were fluent.

55
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,220
It was a couple in their late 20s I guess,
she was German and he was Norwegian.

56
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
I was amazed about their language skills so
they told me that the secret to their success

57
00:03:38,629 --> 00:03:39,629
was that they had a duolingual relationship.

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,700
That is our…

59
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Tip # 3
Have a dualingual relationship.

60
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,260
What does that mean.

61
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:50,819
It means, in their case, that she speaks to
him in German and he speaks to her in Norwegian.

62
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,209
So, they communicate with each other but each
one uses their strongest language to do so.

63
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,540
That is a fantastic way to learn a language
naturally.

64
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,550
Exactly the opposite of learning the “basics”
like, “Hello, my name is Pedro…”

65
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,550
Obviously, when they are too tired or need
to discuss something important, they switch

66
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:18,049
to English.

67
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,049
You can do that too!

68
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,520
You will be amazed about how fast you will
learn your partner´s language.

69
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,750
It also has a nice side effect and that is
that your children will get more exposure

70
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,810
to the minority language since they are going
to hear it more often at home.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
Tip # 4
Use a language learning app.

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
There will come a point when you will need
some more guidance and structure to keep on

73
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,610
developing your language skills.

74
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,770
For example Duolingo, Babbel, Rosetta Stone
or my favorite one LingQ.

75
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,820
I´m at that point with my Danish skills for
example.

76
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,750
I understand almost every conversation between
my husband and my children.

77
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
It´s so much easier when we meet his family
because in comparison to some years ago, I´ve

78
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
made a lot of progress.

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Can I speak fluently, no, not yet, but I can
understand and follow the conversations.

80
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
I reply in German or in English when we are
in DK and that works just fine, for now.

81
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
But I want to keep on developing my skills
because my children are getting better and

82
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:31,110
better and I want to be able to keep up in
the future.

83
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,820
So, in the past I used Duolingo to practice
some Danish, mostly during vacations, but

84
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:40,590
now I´ve changed to LingQ because I really
like Steve Kaufmann´s language learning approach.

85
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,730
For those of you that don´t know him.

86
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,930
He is a polyglot and influencer and co-founder
of LingQ.com.

87
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,050
He has a YouTube channel with videos about
language learning.

88
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,520
You can check that out if you are interested.

89
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,610
Anyway, in a nutshell, what I personally like
about that app is that it allows you to immerse

90
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,270
yourself into a language naturally, without
having the pressure of memorizing vocabulary

91
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,330
or having to learn boring things, like the
basics.

92
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,550
The content has lots of repetitions and I
find it very easy to keep on making progress

93
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,690
in Danish.

94
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,960
I like LinqQ quite a lot.

95
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,220
Maybe it´s something for you too, maybe not.

96
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:30,710
Who knows.

97
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,710
You need to try and see what works for you.

98
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,210
But again, language learning apps are always
a good supplement.

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,900
Tip # 5
Create immersive opportunities for yourself.

100
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,370
It at some point you really want to progress
faster, then you can try the following things.

101
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,750
For example: change your phone´s language
to your partner´s language, listen to music

102
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:53,910
in that language, watch movies or TV in that
language, visit the country, ask family and

103
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,340
friends to speak it with you.

104
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,390
But most importantly: have fun, enjoy it.

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
Don´t try too hard, just expose yourself
with an open mind and without too high expectations.

106
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,190
Learning a new language takes time, so be
patient and I assure you, you won´t regret

107
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
it.

108
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
If you need a personal chat with me, just
drop me a message on my webpage
