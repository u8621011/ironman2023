00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:07,029
How to discover business opportunities

2
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:08,029
When Walt Disney started Disneyland in 1955,
the idea came from taking his kids to a park

3
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:13,289
to have fun.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,940
According to Disney, "It started with me taking
my two kids around to zoos and parks.

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:21,869
While they were on the merry-go-round riding
40 times or something, I'd be sitting there

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,140
trying to figure out what you could do that
would be more imaginative.

7
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,380
I got the idea for a three-dimensional thing
that people could come and visit.

8
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:36,079
I felt that there should be something built
where the parents and the children could have

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
fun together."

10
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:42,890
Earl Nightingale said that "Everything Begins
With An Idea."

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Also, according to Victor Hugo, "There Is
One Thing Stronger Than All The Armies In

12
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,149
The World, And That Is An Idea Whose Time
Has Come."

13
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,399
You see, the first step to discovering any
business opportunity is coming up with an

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,440
idea that will be the basis or foundation
for your business to grow.

15
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,100
In the case of Disney, it started with the
idea of coming up with an idea that will be

16
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,159
beneficial to both kids and parents.

17
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,670
The question, however, is, how can one come
up with a relevant business idea and how to

18
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:20,070
develop the idea to create the perfect business
for one's self and one's brand?

19
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,610
In this video, I’ll share with you how to
discover business opportunities.

20
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,470
This, I believe will help you become a successful
person.

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,090
If you’re new here, consider subscribing
so that you won’t miss other interesting

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,960
videos like this.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,520
You see, Andy Boynton, co-author of The Idea
Hunter said, "The world around you is filled

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
with ideas that can be useful."

25
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,570
So, the first step isn't to start racking
your brain to come up with the most genius

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,810
idea whatsoever but to take time to search
around you and recognize some of the ideas

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,390
that lie around, waiting to be picked up by
someone who can develop the idea.

28
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,229
You're probably wondering why it is important
to start by recognizing or creating ideas

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,399
necessary to meet a need, right?

30
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Harvey S. Firestone said, “If you have ideas,
you have the main asset you need, and there

31
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
isn’t any limit to what you can do with
your business.

32
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,849
Ideas are any man’s greatest asset.”

33
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,080
You know what?

34
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,150
Let's talk about what a business opportunity
is and also, what makes a good business opportunity.

35
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,410
Thereafter, we can further discuss how to
discover one.

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
What is a business opportunity?

37
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:37,849
A business opportunity is an attractive proposition
that provides the possibility of a return

38
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,010
for the person taking the risk, which in this
case is you.

39
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,099
This opportunity usually requires the provision
of a product or a service that is valuable

40
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,450
to the buyer or the end-user.

41
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:54,090
What makes a good business opportunity?

42
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,030
1.

43
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:58,030
It must meet a need
A good idea isn't necessarily a good business

44
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,650
opportunity if it doesn't meet a particular
need.

45
00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:06,049
For instance, you may invent a brilliant technical
product that might not make much sense to

46
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,680
a school teacher because it isn't in any way
meeting any needs of hers.

47
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,450
Remember what we said earlier about business
opportunities?

48
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:19,230
It must be valuable to the buyer or the end-user.

49
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,959
In the case where the need is already being
met, you can come up with ways to make it

50
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
even better.

51
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:29,770
For instance, the idea of a park wasn't new
but Disney simply came up with a way to make

52
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:35,299
it better, by involving parents in the fun.

53
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:38,959
2.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The opportunity should and must work in the
location that you are establishing it

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,010
Again, you need to consider the location of
the business.

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,220
For instance, what is considered to work in
one location might not work in another.

57
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,120
For instance, making and selling fur coats
in temperate regions might not be a good idea.

58
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,579
However, in tropical regions, you can be sure
to make sales as long as other business conditions

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,150
are considered and met.

60
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,450
If the opportunity meets a need that's great,
but it isn't going to mean much if that need

61
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,719
isn't specific to your location.

62
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,310
There has to be a demand for the business
to thrive.

63
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,370
3.

64
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,890
The right pricing for the market
When considering the need that your idea is

65
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,050
solving or required to solve, you should also
consider the people that the product or service

66
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,930
is intended for.

67
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:33,419
Hence, your pricing should be based on the
market.

68
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,550
For instance, if your product is targeted
towards helping the need for a low-income

69
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,590
earner, then the product/service shouldn't
be overpriced, but easily affordable for them.

70
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,250
Ask yourself whether or not you can provide
the product or service at a price the market

71
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,180
can handle.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Will your price attract customers while still
earning you a profit?

73
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,460
Now, that we know what a good business opportunity
should look like, how can we discover one?

74
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:02,949
1.

75
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,130
Recognize and listen to your potential target
audience

76
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:08,490
Remember what we said about every business
starting with a good idea?

77
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,830
Let's consider Disney's idea once again.

78
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
After the thought of making something that
can be favorable to both parties (parents

79
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
and kids), do you think he just replicated
the things he had seen in other parks into

80
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,550
his or he had to come up with interesting
things that can captivate the parents?

81
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,699
Of course, he had to.

82
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:32,850
In this situation, the parents were his target
audience, not the kids.

83
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:37,110
So coming up with fun things for the parents
means he had to listen to his target audience

84
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,830
by doing several types of research before
eventually building Disneyland.

85
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,259
Once he built Disneyland, he will spend days
and nights in there, observing guests, ride

86
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:52,530
operators, food servers, merchandise, and
custodial staff to find out what some of the

87
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
challenges were, what people were complaining
about and they could make these things better.

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,280
For instance, he was able to discover things
like low ride capacity, congested walkways,

89
00:06:08,099 --> 00:06:09,099
traffic jams, and slow food service.

90
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:11,770
If your business is going to thrive, then
you need to learn to listen to your audience,

91
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:16,810
after all, your goal is to serve them, not
yourself.

92
00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:20,289
2.

93
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,289
Take a clue from your competitors
You see, there are so many companies out there

94
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,819
that are probably doing what you are doing
or what you want to do, which is why you need

95
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:31,630
to identify what they are not doing but is
equally valuable to your target audience.

96
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,300
You can do a competitive analysis (don’t
let it lead to competitive paralysis though)

97
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,550
to see what other startups are doing, and
more importantly, not doing.

98
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:47,470
Doing this will help you recognize business
opportunities that can help expand your market

99
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,550
reach and develop your products and services.

100
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,319
3.

101
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Understand the industry you are going into
Nothing speaks brand credibility and professionalism

102
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,639
than showing your expertise in your industry.

103
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,580
When you understand your industry, you know
what is important and what is not.

104
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:10,949
Mostly, you'll learn how to provide quality
products or services that will match the industry

105
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
standard.

106
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,630
Remember, in the end, you are not the only
person providing that particular product,

107
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,370
there are a good number of people as well.

108
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,440
Hence, the more recognized you are in your
industry, the better your opportunity of expanding

109
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,170
your market and sales, in return.

110
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,210
Summary

111
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:37,259
If you want to discover business opportunities,
1.

112
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,940
Make sure your ideas meet people's need
2.

113
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:44,819
Identify and listen to your potential clients
and customers so that you can continue to

114
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:49,919
serve them better, meeting their challenges
in creative and impressive ways.

115
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:55,030
3.

116
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
Do a competitive analysis and find out what
your competitors aren't doing so that you

117
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:01,039
can provide a much better solution for your
customers.

118
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,580
