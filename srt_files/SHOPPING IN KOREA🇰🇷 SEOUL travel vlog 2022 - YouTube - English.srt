essential mask to start my day

5
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,140
hey it's Jackie and I'm currently in Seoul 
back in 2019 I uploaded my first experience  

6
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,900
in South Korea and I'm headed to the olive 
young Awards and Festa think of it like a  

7
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
big convention there's also Awards so these are 
products that are really popular for Koreans and  

8
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,100
they have amazing taste because I've already 
used a bunch of products they're incredible

9
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
foreign

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,440
bow in my hair this isn't the dress I'm 
wearing I'm gonna wear something a little  

11
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
more conservative because in my first video 
I wore a lot of strapless just because I'm  

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,200
used to that and people were like yeah 
and in South Korea like they tend to  

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,620
wear higher necklines it's a little 
more modest so I picked out an outfit  

14
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:35,860
that I think is still my style but maybe a 
little bit more appropriate Let's Get It On

15

good morning breakfast time

28
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,580
I ordered from Olive young beforehand and 
I've been loving using these products they  

29
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,080
have quite a range so some things are more 
affordable this is from their premium line  

30
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
for example and I keep grabbing for this 
really unique lip product here look at this

foreign

34
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,540
spot pad calming touch and they don't use 
a lot of heart leaf in like North America  

35
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,080
so this is kind of a unique product and it is 
very calming I also want to try some toner pads

36
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
foreign

37
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480

out and woke up this morning so I think we're

these notifications to my phones like emergency  

43
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
alerts but they were in Korean so I could not 
understand them but apparently there was a  

44
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,760
hazardous dust warning within the snow there was 
sandstorms coming in from China and Mongolia but  

45

foreign

62
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
I just finished filming for my main Channel and 
I went over my favorite products that I've been  

63
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
using all week that were all Olive Young Award 
winners but I also wanted to share some behind the  

64
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
scenes that I didn't really get on camera because 
me and Tyler were just like very frustrated we  

65
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,080
went shopping at the Lotte Tower which I've been 
before so I was like comfortable going there and  

66
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,820
we got a cab no problem and then we were trying 
to get back and all the cabs were refusing us  

67
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,620
like just saying no and I didn't know if we were 
doing something like offensive if we were doing  

68
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
something wrong turns out we weren't I Googled it 
after and apparently it's a bit of a problem here  

69
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
where um cab drivers will refuse you if it's not 
like a long enough trip but we ended up doing the  

70
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,040
public transit system which is incredible but 
it's hard to navigate obviously when you don't  

71
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,600
know what any of the signs say so Tyler came in 
clutch he you know read the map he got us home it  

72
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,300
really we really weren't all that far but um I was 
close to tears and here's a video of me walking  

73
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
after walking for way too long 
and being a little over tired  

74
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Circle bus for her in this moment 
I'm Claire I'm not a massive eclair

75
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
it's such a sunny day today I got these 
yesterday and I think they're my favorite  

76
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
thing that I got they sit on your 
coffee cup I did get the sandwich  

77
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,280
maker I do make a lot of sandwiches and 
this is way more fun to make cramps better

78
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
they have so many favorites

79
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,240
picked up some nails from Olive 
young I haven't tried them so I'm  

80
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,240
hoping that they fit my fingers 
well but I really love this one

81
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:17,860
I've got this beautiful cardigan from the mall  

82
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
currently navigating on my own I'm gonna go 
to try to find a Korean corn dog wish me luck

83
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,740
the corn dog was not meant to be I'm currently 
at the coffee bean I have a really pretty drink  

84
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
here but um yeah I walked all the way to a place 
called dog and dog and it was a corn dog place  

85
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
the like themed cafes so the quest continues but  

86
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm freezing it is so cold 
so I got a really cute latte

87
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,300
intended with the lashes and the liner I ended 
up re-filming this tutorial for my main Channel  

88
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,820
because the light was just changing too much 
in the room so my second attempt is now live  

89
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,020
if you want to check it out and the outfit 
is from the store that was the equivalent  

90
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,560
of a Korean origia down to not having a beer in 
the changing room but having to walk out to the  

91
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
communal mirror and face judgment and I would have 
loved to have sightseed more but we didn't end up  

92
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,180
having enough time because it was quite a short 
trip and I had to film and do a lot of content

93
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
if you want to keep watching and see Seoul in 
the summer check out my previous video from 2019.

94
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,460
we did have one hour before heading to the airport 
and went to the dollar store which was so much fun

95
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,640
about 60 for all this

96
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
we're off to the airport
