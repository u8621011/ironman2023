10
00:00:17,024 --> 00:00:18,024
Hey Psych2Goers,

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,200
do you often wish you
could stop feeling regret?

12
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,860
Ever since the dawn time,
people have struggled to find

13
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,550
the secret to the meaning of life.

14
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,700
And while there isn't an answer yet,

15
00:00:29,632 --> 00:00:30,632
our centuries of shared
experiences and introspection

16
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,580
have brought us a few steps closer

17
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:36,710
by better understanding
what makes life worth living

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,980
and overcoming the
things that hold us back.

19
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:42,980
With that said, here are 10
mistakes you should never make

20
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,330
if you want to avoid lifelong regret.

21
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:49,470
Number one, taking loved ones for granted.

22
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
In one of the longest
and most famous studies

23
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,540
done on the psychology of happiness,

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,900
according to the Harvard
study of adult development,

25
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,430
psychiatrist Robert Waldinger found that

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
happiness is most strongly
correlated, not with success,

27
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,750
status, wealth or achievement,

28
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,620
but with the quality of
close personal relationships.

29
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:13,670
That's why when you're lucky enough

30
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,090
to have people in your life

31
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,130
who truly love and care about you,

32
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:17,910
you shouldn't take them for granted

33
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,830
or wait until it's too late
to spend time with them.

34
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:22,970
Number two, not following your dreams.

35
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,500
When we're young, it's easy for us to have

36
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
lots of hopes and dreams in life

37
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,900
because we feel like the sky's the limit.

38
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:32,410
But as we grow older, it gets
harder to follow those dreams

39
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,170
because of our everyday responsibilities,

40
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,010
such as paying bills and
maybe raising a family.

41
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,620
But if you truly have
a calling or a passion

42
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,560
that gives your soul purpose,

43
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,660
giving up on it in favor of
following someone else's idea

44
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,390
of what you should do in your life

45
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
or choosing the path of least resistance

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:51,960
is one of the biggest
mistakes you can make.

47
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,242
Number three, not expanding your horizons.

48
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:58,256
As the famous movie quote goes,

49
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,700
life is short the world is wide,

50
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,350
and I wanna make some memories.

51
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,207
Whether it's traveling the world,

52
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,270
moving to a new city, taking a risk,

53
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,740
or simply trying to allow
yourself to discover

54
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,670
all the great experiences
life has to offer.

55
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,190
Because if you don't,

56
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,580
you'll spend the rest of
your life during, what if?

57
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,130
Number four, wasting your time
on things that don't matter.

58
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,430
The older you get, the more
you realize things like

59
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,410
gossip, fake friends,
popularity, social media,

60
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,530
pretending to be someone you're not

61
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,550
and always worrying about
whether other people like you

62
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
won't really matter in the end,

63
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,530
and yet we can't help it
waste our time on them anyway.

64
00:02:41,934 --> 00:02:42,934
The sooner we realize there
are so many better ways

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
we could be spending our time and energy,

66
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
the better off we'll be.

67
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,040
Number five, settling into
relationships too quickly.

68
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Even if you don't believe
in romance, destiny,

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
soulmates or true love,

70
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,830
that's no excuse for you

71
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,830
to simply settle for a
relationship you're not happy in

72
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
or fulfilled by just because you're tired

73
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:04,910
of waiting for the right one

74
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,020
or afraid you'll end up alone.

75
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Both you and your partner deserve someone

76
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,310
who accepts you for who you really are,

77
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,450
who will love you in
spite of all your flaws

78
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,470
and make you happier than you
ever thought you could be.

79
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,330
So don't settle for anything less.

80
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Number six, compromising your health.

81
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,310
Do you smoke or drink a lot,

82
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:27,910
or maybe you just don't
exercise regularly,

83
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,900
or you eat a lot of junk food?

84
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,610
It's easy to neglect your
health when you're young,

85
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,520
but don't make the mistake of waiting

86
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,210
until it's too late to start
taking care of your body.

87
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,980
No matter how busy your schedule,

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,720
you should find time to eat well,

89
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:43,613
exercise and get enough rest.

90
00:03:45,232 --> 00:03:46,232
Avoid unhealthy habits like smoking,

91
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,680
overeating and binge drinking

92
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,770
and your older self will
be grateful to you for it.

93
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,630
Number seven, getting in debt.

94
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:57,271
You know the saying never bite
off more than you can chew?

95
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,440
That definitely applies to our attitude

96
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,110
towards money and spending.

97
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,870
Sure saving money can seem like

98
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,800
it's not a big priority right now,

99
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
especially when splurging on
impulse buys and luxury goods

100
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,270
like lavish vacations or expensive phones,

101
00:04:13,115 --> 00:04:14,115
gives you such a high,

102
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
but you'll regret going into
more debt than you can repay

103
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,870
when the time comes.

104
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:21,790
Number eight, being overly
dependent on others.

105
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Of course, it's only natural

106
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
for us to feel lonely from
time to time, and when we do,

107
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
we tend to gravitate towards other people

108
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
for comfort and reassurance.

109
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:33,118
But it's another thing
entirely when we do it so much

110
00:04:35,148 --> 00:04:36,148
that it makes us dependent
on them for our happiness,

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,760
self-esteem and sense of identity.

112
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,630
Remember, people who are
emotionally dependent on others

113
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,460
often become clingy, needy, moody,

114
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,141
unsuccessful, and unhappy.

115
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,490
Number nine, having a bad
relationship with yourself.

116
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:55,594
One of the worst ways

117
00:04:56,245 --> 00:04:57,245
you can destroy your own
chances at happiness and success

118
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:00,930
is by having a negative
relationship with yourself.

119
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,930
Yet so many of us are guilty of doing it.

120
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:07,430
We think that being self-critical

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
helps us become better
versions of ourselves

122
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,740
when really the opposite is true.

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
When we are kind empathetic, encouraging,

124
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,790
and supportive of ourselves,
we flourish so much more.

125
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
So know your worth,

126
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,700
let go of those limiting beliefs

127
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,160
and start practicing self-love

128
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,490
to start living a better life today.

129
00:05:27,808 --> 00:05:28,808
And number 10, forgetting
to live in the moment.

130
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,910
Last, but certainly not least,

131
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,760
let's say never forget
that life is fleeting

132
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,250
and every moment is precious.

133
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:40,501
Sometimes we get carried away

134
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
by the hustle and bustle of everyday life

135
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,650
and we start to take
all the simple pleasures

136
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:46,970
and worthwhile moments
in life for granted.

137
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,279
We are so caught up in
our future and our past

138
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,900
that we fail to see all
the good we have have

139
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,510
right in front of us, right now,

140
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,900
here, in the present moment.

141
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:00,610
In the words of Anne Frank,

142
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,028
how wonderful it is that nobody
need wait a single moment

143
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,800
before beginning to improve the world.

144
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,660
And the same applies to your life too.

145
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:10,971
So do you agree with all the
things we've mentioned here?

146
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Let us know in the comments below,

147
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,770
and if you sometimes find yourself

148
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:17,790
making some of these
mistakes, that's okay.

149
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
Remember that it's never
too late to change,

150
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,580
that's the beauty of life.

151
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,177
