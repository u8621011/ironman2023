00:00:01,115 --> 00:00:02,115
Hi there.

2
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:02,895
Today let's talk about language learning.

3
00:00:04,895 --> 00:00:05,895
Most of us have the idea that
language learning is difficult,

4
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:10,845
so I'm gonna share with you today
some research which is really

5
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:15,105
encouraging about language learning.

6
00:00:18,125 --> 00:00:19,125
You know, our goal, our point,
our purpose is to help you

7
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:23,655
arrive at fluency in English.

8
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:27,285
And if you've done our Seven Rules
Course, you'll understand the mechanisms,

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:32,625
the method behind what we do here.

10
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:36,027
But language learning is a challenge.

11
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:39,027
So let me share this
encouraging research with you.

12
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:42,957
You'll be amazed, I think.

13
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:04,649
Oh, and what did I hear you say?

14
00:01:06,109 --> 00:01:07,109
You haven't done the Seven
Rules of Adept English yet?

15
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,289
Well, you are missing out.

16
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:12,899
If you go to our website, you
can sign up for this course

17
00:01:14,779 --> 00:01:15,779
straight away and it is free.

18
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:18,599
What have you got to lose?

19
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,249
The Seven Rules of Adept English
explains exactly how best to use our

20
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,779
podcasts so that you can arrive at
speaking English fluently more quickly.

21
00:01:30,919 --> 00:01:31,919
Let's get on meanwhile, with that
encouraging research, shall we?

22
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,719
So an article published in The
Conversation back in August this

23
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:42,364
year, that's 2022, by Monika
Schmid of the University of York.

24
00:01:49,249 --> 00:01:50,249
She's done some surprisingly encouraging
research about learning a language.

25
00:01:54,376 --> 00:01:55,376
The article was published just after
the GCSE and A level results were

26
00:01:59,806 --> 00:02:00,806
out, as usual in the UK in August.

27
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,166
So these exams are the ones that
16 year olds and 18 year olds take.

28
00:02:07,996 --> 00:02:08,996
16 year olds take GCSEs, which
stands for General Certificate

29
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:13,491
in Secondary Education.

30
00:02:14,471 --> 00:02:15,471
And the 18 year olds take their
A Levels or Advanced Levels.

31
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,631
And the A level results are what
determine whether or not they're

32
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,541
getting to university or onto some
other course of study or training.

33
00:02:28,421 --> 00:02:29,421
So they're important exams.

34
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,084
You can take the IGCSE, the International
GCSE in many parts of the world and some

35
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:39,019
countries have GCSEs, just like in the UK.

36
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,679
They have GCSEs in Nigeria, for example.

37
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:45,966
And a lot of Commonwealth
countries do the A level as well.

38
00:02:49,866 --> 00:02:50,866
So the evidence cited in this
newspaper article is very surprising.

39
00:02:55,436 --> 00:02:56,436
They're saying that the knowledge
of a foreign language as learned

40
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:00,306
in school stays 'astonishingly
stable' over a long period of time.

41
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,951
Vocabulary here - 'astonishingly'?

42
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,881
Well, that's A S T O N I S H
I N G L Y, 'astonishingly'.

43
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:19,541
And that's an adverb,
it describes the verb.

44
00:03:21,391 --> 00:03:22,391
And it's from the verb 'to astonish'.

45
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:25,601
If you 'astonish' someone, it means
that you surprise them, but it's

46
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,701
a lot more surprise - it's like
'extreme surprise', astonishment.

47
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,821
So 'astonishingly' means 'very, very
surprisingly' - stable, S T A B L E.

48
00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:45,601
Now, that can be a noun and it's
where you might put a horse.

49
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:49,141
A horse's house is called 'a
stable', but here it's an adjective.

50
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,641
And if something is 'stable',
it means it's 'unchanging'.

51
00:03:58,191 --> 00:03:59,191
So basically what we're saying here is
that if you learn a foreign language in

52
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,201
school, that foreign language knowledge
that you've gained is 'stable over time'.

53
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:10,681
It means you really don't lose
it, and that apparently is

54
00:04:14,001 --> 00:04:15,001
so, even if you don't use it.

55
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:18,161
There is a phrase 'use it or lose it'.

56
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:21,451
And the suggestion here is for that,
for language learning that's not true.

57
00:04:25,311 --> 00:04:26,311
So Professor Monika Schmid, the author
and the person who's conducted the

58
00:04:31,191 --> 00:04:32,191
research, she cites another piece of
research that was done 40 years ago.

59
00:04:37,281 --> 00:04:38,281
She says, The psychologist Harry P Bahrick
carried out an investigation of some

60
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:43,626
600 Americans who had learned Spanish in
high school up to 50 years previously.

61
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,061
Apparently, there's a small
amount of loss three to six years

62
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:54,961
after the lessons have ended.

63
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:57,691
But this researcher found mainly that the
knowledge of Spanish appeared 'stable'

64
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:04,231
even 50 years after they'd learnt it!

65
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:07,771
So it's as though, once it's learnt, these
words just stick around in your memory.

66
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,441
You don't forget them.

67
00:05:13,821 --> 00:05:14,821
Rather like the words of your
native language, perhaps?

68
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:18,271
Even if you're not using them as
well, which I found surprising.

69
00:05:21,126 --> 00:05:22,126
It's estimated that language learners
keep hold of 70% of the language learning

70
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:27,466
they've done, even if not using it.

71
00:05:30,276 --> 00:05:31,276
But in other subjects,
that information erodes.

72
00:05:34,266 --> 00:05:35,266
I'm thinking of History.

73
00:05:35,886 --> 00:05:36,886
I can remember what I studied in
History at school, but I certainly

74
00:05:39,516 --> 00:05:40,516
can't remember the detail of it.

75
00:05:42,194 --> 00:05:43,194
In her study, Professor Monika Schmid
carried out tests on English speaking

76
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:48,594
people who were students of French 50
years ago, and they still remembered

77
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:54,834
the grammar and vocabulary just as well
as those who learned it more recently.

78
00:05:58,677 --> 00:05:59,677
And that's true where they hadn't
used their French for many years.

79
00:06:02,427 --> 00:06:03,427
I found that really
surprising and encouraging.

80
00:06:05,607 --> 00:06:06,607
But once it's in your brain,
it's there for life it seems!

81
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:10,627
Professor Monika Schmid, I think it's
Schmid, S C H M I D, says "Some parts

82
00:06:16,552 --> 00:06:17,552
of language, mainly the vocabulary are
memorized in the same way as facts, rules

83
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:22,677
of algebra, dates, names, and so on.

84
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:25,587
This memory system is indeed
vulnerable to (some) erosion."

85
00:06:29,747 --> 00:06:30,747
That means you do lose a little of it.

86
00:06:32,327 --> 00:06:33,327
She says.

87
00:06:33,257 --> 00:06:34,257
" Other parts though, like grammar,
are learned in a way that is much

88
00:06:36,737 --> 00:06:37,737
more similar to riding a bicycle.

89
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:40,047
We use the part of our brain that is
good at remembering rules and sequences.

90
00:06:43,117 --> 00:06:44,117
So grammar becomes more like
a reflex and that kind of

91
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:47,027
knowledge resists forgetting."

92
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,880
That's the learning that we're
talking about that becomes automatic.

93
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:54,463
So is Monica Schmid saying that vocabulary
memory erodes, meaning it is lost?

94
00:06:59,493 --> 00:07:00,493
Or does she not mean that?

95
00:07:00,873 --> 00:07:01,873
That's a little bit confusing.

96
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:03,163
However, she does go on to say that
because vocabulary in another language

97
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:08,983
has its equivalent in your language,
it gets 'refreshed' each time you

98
00:07:13,443 --> 00:07:14,443
use the word in your own language.

99
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:17,743
And that's even if you aren't using
your second language, and even if

100
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:22,363
they're not similar sounding words.

101
00:07:24,303 --> 00:07:25,303
So she gives the example of
'banana' and 'banane' in French.

102
00:07:29,133 --> 00:07:30,133
So every time you say 'banana'
in English, you are reminded

103
00:07:33,273 --> 00:07:34,273
of 'une banane' in French.

104
00:07:35,926 --> 00:07:36,926
She says that the neurons that contain the
words for an object also contain the word

105
00:07:42,886 --> 00:07:43,886
in the other language that you learned.

106
00:07:46,576 --> 00:07:47,576
So the word in your second language is
stimulated and refreshed every time you

107
00:07:53,476 --> 00:07:54,476
use that word in your native language.

108
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,136
She gives the example of 'apple' in
English and the French for 'apple',

109
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:03,146
if you know it, is 'pomme', P O M M E.

110
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:07,376
If you're an English speaker, apparently
each time you say the word 'apple', the

111
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:11,967
French for 'apple' - 'pomme' is also
stimulated and refreshed in your brain.

112
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,497
So similarly, 'potato' will
stimulate 'pomme de terre' or

113
00:08:23,107 --> 00:08:24,107
'Kartoffel', if you know German.

114
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:26,837
That's without you realizing it.

115
00:08:28,327 --> 00:08:29,327
That's automatic and unconscious.

116
00:08:31,282 --> 00:08:32,282
Professor Monika Schmid also makes the
point that it doesn't mean that you

117
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:36,302
can just start chatting in a foreign
language, fluently and automatically.

118
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:41,747
I think most of us language
learners do know that!

119
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:44,965
And it's perhaps the case that if you
learnt a language in school, you probably

120
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
didn't arrive at being fluent anyway.

121
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:52,085
It takes far more listening
to a language than is done in

122
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,100
school to help that happen.

123
00:08:57,351 --> 00:08:58,351
But what it does mean is that grammar
and vocabulary that you learned up to 50

124
00:09:02,406 --> 00:09:03,406
years ago is still in there somewhere.

125
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:06,971
You haven't forgotten it.

126
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:08,021
You haven't lost it all together.

127
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:10,301
We have a saying in English - 'It's
at the back of my mind',  meaning that

128
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
some piece of information or some memory
is not at the forefront of my mind.

129
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,060
It's not what I'm focused on,
but it's in there somewhere.

130
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,420
It can be 'wakened up', if you like.

131
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:26,974
Some of the people in this research
who were tested, learned their second

132
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:31,714
language 50 years ago in school.

133
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,324
They haven't used that language since.

134
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:37,069
And they still haven't lost it.

135
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:39,319
They could still answer the questions
and do quite well on a written test.

136
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:44,467
The human brain is amazing, isn't it?

137
00:09:46,414 --> 00:09:47,414
The article also talks about how
there is a decline in the numbers

138
00:09:51,394 --> 00:09:52,394
of students - children studying
languages at GCSE and A level.

139
00:09:57,242 --> 00:09:58,242
That's disappointing.

140
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,132
In fact, amongst my three children,
when my daughters, who're older went

141
00:10:04,202 --> 00:10:05,202
through school, it was obligatory
to learn a language at GCSE level.

142
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:11,082
They had no choice.

143
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:12,732
So I encouraged both of them to
learn French as we have family

144
00:10:15,842 --> 00:10:16,842
in France and it makes sense.

145
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:18,826
However, now that my son is
doing his GCSEs, the language

146
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:23,669
learning isn't obligatory.

147
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:25,499
They're no longer made to do a language.

148
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,159
He knew I wanted him to do French,
but he didn't want to do it and has

149
00:10:31,939 --> 00:10:32,939
chosen some other subject instead.

150
00:10:34,309 --> 00:10:35,309
That seems a shame, especially when we
now know that your language learning

151
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,509
in school stays with you a lot longer.

152
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:43,439
A lot longer than any of us had realized!

153
00:10:44,659 --> 00:10:45,659
So perhaps this research supports
the idea that language learning in

154
00:10:49,434 --> 00:10:50,434
schools should go on for longer.

155
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:53,579
Most children in British schools
learn either French or German

156
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:58,289
and Spanish, probably up until
Year 9, so up to the age of 15.

157
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,364
And then they're permitted to drop it
when they choose their GCSE subjects.

158
00:11:08,704 --> 00:11:09,704
I think rather like PE, a language
should be something that you continue

159
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,679
with for another couple of years because
this language learning it appears,

160
00:11:20,584 --> 00:11:21,584
stays with you possibly forever.

161
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:24,404
So it's well worth doing!

162
00:11:25,045 --> 00:11:26,045
But also let that serve as
some encouragement to you

163
00:11:29,335 --> 00:11:30,335
in your language learning.

164
00:11:31,606 --> 00:11:32,606
We do often think about how
difficult it is to learn a

165
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:36,386
language and how long it takes.

166
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,395
But I think this is encouraging.

167
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:41,225
Whatever vocabulary you commit - and
I would imagine it's - to long

168
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:46,370
term memory now, your brain will
remember it for many years to come.

169
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:52,149
Maybe even you'll remember
it in 50 years time.

170
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:56,019
Wow!

171
00:11:55,709 --> 00:11:56,709
Your brain is amazing!

172
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,149
And getting the grammar to be automatic
and the vocabulary to be stored

173
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:03,759
in long term memory and available
and ready when you want to speak?

174
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:09,099
Well, of course, as we know, that's best
achieved by lots and lots of listening.

175
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,329
That's what we do.

176
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:17,259
That's what we help you
with at Adept English.

177
00:12:18,689 --> 00:12:19,689
Enough for now.

178
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:20,709
Have a lovely day.

179
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:21,819
Speak to you again soon.

180
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:23,109
Goodbye.
