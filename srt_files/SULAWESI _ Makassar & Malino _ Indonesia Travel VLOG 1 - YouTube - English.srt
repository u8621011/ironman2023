right manoli so what is also funny about this is  

13
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,600
you can see all the residues let's 
say i don't know if it's visible on the camera  

14
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,440
from all the people looking at the 
views here but okay it's very good

15
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440

16
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
so we have this amazing guy who is 
giving us actually a real life concert  

17
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,040
to the neighborhood to the neighborhood

18
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
what do you think about that it's amazing 
it's nice to have this kind of like concert  

19
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
he's so passionate passionate about 
singing but we really like it and enjoy

20
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,240
wow

21
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
so this is a very nice waterfall in the 
malino region yeah and you can see its beauty

22
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
so we have a really really 
nice rainbow on this waterfall

23
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
very very nice

24
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
so we are now here at this really nice free 
hanging bridge and it does not only look  

25
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
shaky it is shaky and how shaky we 
will see now so let us experience

26
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,320
you can see the maintenance of this 
bridge is also not anymore the best and  

27
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,920
there is a sign mentioning that we should 
walk slowly over the bridge and so we will do

28
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,280
and already now i can feel the shaking

29
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
pretty crazy as you can see if you're 
scared about this kind of thing i think  

30
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
this bridge is not the way to go for you and 
also you can see there are some kind of gifts

31
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
so till now everything is quite okay 
even though we are standing still  

32
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
the bridge is still a little bit shaking

33
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
and there's a small river

34
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
so hello here you have marquisa we bought it on 
the market it's really a nice fruit i think it's  

35
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,880
like a passion fruit or actually it is a passion 
fruit you just simply can open it up like this

36
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
and you can eat it it's very tasty

37
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000

now we drive to bira bira beach

38
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
and there is a really nice beach nice surrounding 
nice cliffs so we will enjoy the ride actually  

39
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
