1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,280
When learning a new language, what's more
important: grammar or vocabulary?

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,300
Well, first I would like to say is that it's really hard
to understand any sentence- or any,

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,520
anything that's being said, in another language, if
you don't understand the syntax that's used,

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:22,939
even if you know the vocabulary, because in
some languages like Spanish, French, Italian

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,340
and English, there's a lot of vocabulary that
is shared between the languages. So you might

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,660
get an idea of what's being said without having
studied that language very much.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,900
But you may not be able to actually communicate in that
language. And so even without grammar, you

8
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:44,379
would be able to understand things. So I would
say that the first part is that if you understand

9
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:48,949
vocabulary that's going to come before grammar.
So even if you understand the vocabulary does

10
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:54,730
not- does not mean that you're going to understand
the whole sentence. The whole sentence is

11
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:58,129
really syntax, and syntax is different than
grammar, grammar is more like declensions

12
00:01:02,109 --> 00:01:03,109
and conjugations of verbs. And you know, where
what words are, are changing other words in

13
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:09,381
the sentence and how adjectives agree with
the, with the, you know, the nouns that they're

14
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,070
describing. And so grammar is kind of a really
loose concept. And so I don't really talk

15
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
about grammar all that much, because they're
like very specific things about it.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,280
When you're learning a language, one of the most important skills

17
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,340
is that you're able to hear the sounds correctly, 
you're able to produce the sound.

18
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
So that's phonology and understanding how

19
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:34,649
the tongue position in your mouth will help
you pronounce things better.

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,100
The second thing will be vocabulary. So without a massive amount

21
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,920
of vocabulary, you can even learn how to speak

22
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:44,359
a language with a small number of words, maybe

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
500 to 1000 words you can you can speak a language fairly-

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,100
fairly okay, if you have a good grasp of the 
syntax and how words go into the sentence.

25
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,160
So for example, in a language like
 Japanese, you know that you're going

26
00:02:00,929 --> 00:02:01,929
to be saying certain things in a certain order
and your verb is going to come last, and in

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,060
German, sometimes you have, you have like
a helping verb at the beginning of a sentence

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,060
and then your main verb is going to go last.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
And so you have to learn how to manipulate

30
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:17,459
words and place them around the sentence.

31
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
And in languages like in the Slavic languages,

32
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,790
for example, Czech, Polish Russian,

33
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
when you want to talk about things that that have been

34
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:29,739
completed, you're going to be using a lot
more prefixes on your verbs and then which

35
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
prefix to use is sort of a grammatical thing.

36
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
But if you're practicing these in full sentences,

37
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,320
you get a feel for how those prefixes work.

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So you'll get an idea of how 'oт' versus 'с' ,

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,040
meaning to come out of, or come away
from, works and it can actually-

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
once you learn that skill, it actually applies across most
of the Slavic languages in the same way.

41
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
It's just you know, what are the main differences
between the languages is probably just some

42
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,790
very slight changes in pronunciation 
structure of the, of the vocabulary.

43
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,820
So I would say that the most important 
skill that you can have is vocabulary.

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
And then if you have the ability to actually analyze vocabulary,

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,560
like you can look at a word and see its history.

46
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,330
For example, if you know that the 'W h' words
in English like 'who, what, when, where, why',

47
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:29,239
and even words like 'while' these words if you
know that they came from a very ancient Indo-European

48
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,870
sound 'kʷ', and then you find that that 'kʷ'
becomes like a 'tʃ' in some languages, becomes

49
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
a 'k' in some other languages comes a 'ð'
in some other languages, you can actually

50
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,130
acquire vocabulary quite quickly. And so,
for example, if you're if you're learning

51
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,030
like a Slavic language, I remember at one
point, you know, I learned the word, chwilę

52
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:58,849
in Polish and it means a while It means like
for a period of time, you know, so it's like,

53
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
oh, while - relay, it's like pronouncing while
with all of the vowels, you know, chwe - ei - ley

54
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,390
So you can sometimes find some connections
between languages between words that seem

55
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,080
on the surface completely different,

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
but they probably do share a common history.

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And so that can actually help you 
acquire vocabulary faster.

58
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
Understanding how the 'p's become 'ph's from like,

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,600
from the Latin languages to Germanic languages.

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,900
There's particular rules in the history of vocabulary that can tell us

61
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
like Grimm's law, and how these sound changes

62
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,110
happen across these different groups of languages.

63
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,340
So one thing that's interesting is 
that if you take a word like

64
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
like, you know, I was just mentioning this
this "Hw" sound, the 'Hw' in 'what', 'while'

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,880
although we don't normally pronounce the 'H' in English,
you get like a sound In German, but in,

66
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
in most of the romance languages, they're
 going to be 'K' sounds, and so you can actually find-

67
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,420
because this is a condition of the of
the of human language in general how sounds

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
change over time, in a natural way,

69
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
you can actually find parallels in other
 language families, for example,

70
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,400
many of you know that I'm a near 
native speaker of Chinese and

71
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
I live in a Chinese speaking environment., and so even in the Chinese world, in the Semitic

72
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,580
world of languages, for example, the differences
between Cantonese and Mandarin, you'll also

73
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:36,449
find words like 花(hua), which means flower, and
that's going to be pronounced か(ka) if the-

74
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,460
for the sound that's borrowed into Japanese, and then-

75
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,740
which is separate than their 
own word, which is hana but

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
you also find that word in Cantonese which 
would be pronounced with a 'fa' so you

77
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,930
have this 'hwa' and then 'fa', you know
that difference between Cantonese and Mandarin

78
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:00,639
kind of similar to how you have between the 
romance languages and dramatic languages.

79
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:04,639
Another example is the word 'kuai' in Mandarin,
which is 'fai' in Cantonese. So when you learn

80
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
the sound changes between languages,

81
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,380
you're also able to pick up vocabulary at a much faster pace

82
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,520
and with more understanding of
vocabulary when you hear things in context,

83
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,630
when you hear a new vocabulary in context,
you're able to understand those sentences

84
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,270
much faster, you're able to pick up on that
vocabulary and turn it around into something

85
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,199
that you're able to use directly right away
in your conversation. And so that's one of

86
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:38,190
the most powerful skills that polyglots will have.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I remember Richard Simcott was 
telling me a story how he would,

88
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,840
he would sometimes share little 
stories of things that he's learned

89
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
from some of the South Slavic languages like
Croatian and Slovene, Serbian and Macedonian.

90
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
And he says, you know, a simple, simple word in Macedonian,

91
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,240
if you just change like one vowel sound, or 
one constant sound you get the equivalent

92
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,740
in Croatian, Serbian and Slovenia. And sometimes

93
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:06,770
people who don't have any knowledge about languages,

94
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,560
even the native Serbian or 
Macedonian speakers will just be like,

95
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
their mind is blown. 
Really? Where do you see that?

96
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I don't understand what how you got to that conclusion.
It sounds completely alien to me. You know

97
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,060
that same word in just across the border sounds
completely alien to a native speaker but the

98
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:26,229
polyglot on the other hand actually hears
the same word with slightly two different pronunciations.

99
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
So you kind of have to think about language 
learning in a sort of a meta state,

100
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,820
you have to step away from it and say:

101
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
Hey, these sound changes happen over a vast area,

102
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,060
and they and they kind of get dispersed
into different languages.

103
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,340
And if I want to focus on just 
improving my French or Italian

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
or one of these languages, you just focus

105
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
on what are the sound changes in there, and
you're able to pick it up very quickly.

106
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,820
You know, one very simple example with French
is that you'll find the same thing happens

107
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,350
in Italian if, if a word starts with a 'st-'
or a 'sp-'

108
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,840
Well, normally the Italians, 
they can't use the regular article

109
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
they can't use,- they have to change it to a 'lo' or 'li', you

110
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,760
know, they have to put a vowel in between
there. And then so that that vowel carries

111
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,590
over into other languages like Spanish and French.

112
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,040
And so in Spanish, you have that additional 
'e' at the beginning of the word.

113
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,080
So instead- instead of saying- saying study, or students

114
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
you would say estudi-.

115
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Estudi- , and in French, that 's' has disappeared, 
so becomes étudiant, étudiante.

116
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
And so you have that specific sound change. 
And when you step back and think

117
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,740
about it in a meta way, and you can see the
big picture, you can see how the sound changes

118
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
are happening. And then you can carry those
ideas over to other language families, like

119
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
for example, in East Asia, or in in Africa,
in North and South America. You can look at

120
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,640
other language families and see how the same
sound changes are happening over time.

121
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,020
And so we can actually find out how old words
are. For example, if words are in one language,

122
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,250
backgrounds, 'k', and another language are
pronounced, 'tʃ', that we know that 'tʃ'

123
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,450
is probably the newer word, because it changed
over time into, it became a softer sound over

124
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:16,610
time, it's probably unlikely that it went
from a 'tʃ' to a 'k' over time.

125
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
So we would say that the code languages is probably the
source, vocabulary for that other language.

126
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:27,860
And there's like hundreds of these little
sound rules that if you know them quite well,

127
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:31,890
you're able to kind of produce the whole other
dialect or language, and even track this language,

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
where it's going into the future

129
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:40,810
and how this language is going to sound in
the future, or maybe how that language sounds

130
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,380
and a neighboring country as a different language.
And so, phonology itself is a very fascinating thing,

131
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,340
but you need to tie phonology in with your vocabulary

132
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
so that you can acquire vocabulary really quick.

133
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,040
You're able to see the word and catch 
on to it and learn it very quickly.
