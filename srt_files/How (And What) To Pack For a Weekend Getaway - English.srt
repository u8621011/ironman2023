1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,060
- All right, here's the situation.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,500
It's February,

3
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,340
and Robin and I are gonna
be spending a weekend

4
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,091
in New York City.

5
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,310
We're gonna take the
train because it's quick,

6
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,960
it's easy, and it's relaxing.

7
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,430
And while we're up there

8
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:10,300
these are the things we're gonna be doing.

9
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,490
Cocktails and a nice
meal, just the two of us,

10
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,830
walking around maybe doing some shopping,

11
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,810
dinner with a couple friends
at really nice restaurant,

12
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:19,150
an early brunch,

13
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
and then finally, heading home.

14
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:21,700
So let's get packing.

15
00:00:22,428 --> 00:00:23,428
(soft music)

16
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,670
I'm Brian Sacawa.

17
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:28,503
This is "He Spoke Style,"

18
00:00:28,517 --> 00:00:29,517
advice and inspiration
to help you dress well,

19
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
develop your personal style,
and be more confident.

20
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,540
So in this video,

21
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:35,530
I'll be showing you what I'm gonna pack

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
for this very specific situation.

23
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,341
I'll go through the basics.

24
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,020
those essential things that I always have

25
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,970
to have with me when I travel.

26
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,380
I'll show you the
specific clothing, shoes,

27
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,210
and accessories that I'll be packing.

28
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,421
I'll do a rundown of
each individual outfit

29
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,380
I'll be bringing.

30
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
And finally,

31
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:52,113
I'll show you how I actually pack it all.

32
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Now, although this is very specific

33
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,080
to my particular situation,

34
00:00:56,947 --> 00:00:57,947
if you follow the
framework that I laid out

35
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,250
at the beginning of the video,

36
00:01:00,307 --> 00:01:01,307
it'll be very easy for you to adapt it

37
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,910
to your specific needs when
you're planning your next trip.

38
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
The first thing to consider
is when you are going?

39
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,760
What season is it?

40
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,960
What's the weather gonna be like?

41
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
It's the first step in
planning what to pack.

42
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:14,770
Second, how long are you going for?

43
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:16,990
This will start to help
you focus in on the amount

44
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
that you'll need to pack,

45
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,470
how big of a bag you're gonna need,

46
00:01:20,866 --> 00:01:21,866
and also some specifics

47
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,530
like how many pairs of
underwear you should bring.

48
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,780
Third, where are you going?

49
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,460
Different destinations
require different clothes.

50
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,010
So what I bring for a weekend in the city

51
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:31,754
is gonna be very different
than what I bring

52
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,120
for a weekend ski trip.

53
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,710
Fourth, how are you traveling?

54
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:37,780
Car, bus, train, plane?

55
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:39,386
That impacts not only the
type of luggage you'll bring,

56
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:42,205
but also the outfit you
wear when you travel.

57
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
And finally, and probably
most importantly,

58
00:01:46,613 --> 00:01:47,613
what are you going to be doing
while you're on that trip?

59
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Knowing your itinerary,
where you're going,

60
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
where you're eating,

61
00:01:53,033 --> 00:01:54,033
the dress code or vibe
of each of those things

62
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,020
is essential to planning each
specific outfit for your trip.

63
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,710
And planning ahead is what
this all really boils down to.

64
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:02,755
Knowing when you're
going, where you're going,

65
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,680
how long you're going
for, how you're traveling,

66
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:07,929
and what you're gonna be doing,

67
00:02:08,344 --> 00:02:09,344
makes it so much easier
to pack more effectively

68
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:11,982
and efficiently.

69
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Alright, so now let's actually
talk about the basics.

70
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,700
And I'm gonna head over
to the desk to talk

71
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:17,860
through those things
beginning with my luggage.

72
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,410
So the bag I'm gonna take
is this rolling carry on.

73
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,350
It's very lightweight.

74
00:02:23,285 --> 00:02:24,285
It's got plenty of room.

75
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,660
The two dividers here make it really easy

76
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,490
to secure everything inside.

77
00:02:27,832 --> 00:02:28,832
It's very easy to stow,

78
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,310
and both the telescoping
handle and the wheels

79
00:02:31,816 --> 00:02:32,816
make it really comfortable
and easy to maneuver.

80
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,320
For weekend trips by car,

81
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,355
I will typically use a duffle bag.

82
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
But since this trip is gonna
involve train stations,

83
00:02:40,181 --> 00:02:41,181
taxis and subways,

84
00:02:42,053 --> 00:02:43,053
the wheel carry-on makes a lot more sense.

85
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,910
Now, two of the biggest
challenges when packing any type

86
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:48,610
of bag are keeping things
organized and having enough space.

87
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,930
And one of the easiest
ways I found to solve both

88
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
of those problems is
by using packing cubes.

89
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,460
I absolutely love these things.

90
00:03:00,811 --> 00:03:01,811
Everything is organized and contained.

91
00:03:03,259 --> 00:03:04,259
Things aren't getting mixed
together or coming out the side

92
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,870
of the suitcase when
I'm trying to close it.

93
00:03:08,443 --> 00:03:09,443
For a short trip like this,

94
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:10,909
I will use one of these in
place of my regular dopp kit

95
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,020
just to save some space,

96
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:15,188
but my favorite part about these

97
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:17,219
is that they are compressible which really

98
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
helps you maximize the
space in your suitcase.

99
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
Now when I travel, I like to read,

100
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,760
but the problem with bringing a book

101
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:26,372
is not only is it heavy,

102
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,450
but it takes up a lot of space.

103
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,430
That's why one of my
basic travel essentials

104
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,370
is a subscription to Audible,
today's video sponsor.

105
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,490
In addition to lightening my suitcase

106
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,590
and giving me more space,

107
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
what I love about Audible
is the incredible selection

108
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,790
of audiobooks.

109
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,930
Literally hundreds of thousands of titles

110
00:03:44,712 --> 00:03:45,712
that they have across every genre.

111
00:03:46,843 --> 00:03:47,843
Right now I'm in the middle
of "Spare" by Prince Harry,

112
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,740
which I highly recommend checking out.

113
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
It's very interesting and inspiring.

114
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,300
As an Audible member,

115
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,170
you're able to choose one title a month

116
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,150
to keep from the entire catalog

117
00:03:58,728 --> 00:03:59,728
and that includes the latest
bestsellers and new releases.

118
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Members also get full access
to a growing selection

119
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:06,173
of included audiobooks, Audible originals,

120
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:09,130
as well as thousands of podcasts.

121
00:04:09,742 --> 00:04:10,742
And you can download and
stream all included titles

122
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:13,862
as much as you want.

123
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,670
Let Audible help you
discover new ways to laugh

124
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
be inspired, or be entertained.

125
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
New members can try it free for 30 days.

126
00:04:20,732 --> 00:04:21,732
All you gotta do is visit
Audible.com/hespokestyle

127
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,120
or text hespokestyle, all one word,

128
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to 500-500 to try
Audible free for 30 days.

129
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,050
Up next, couple small things.

130
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,790
First, gotta have some
headphones to listen

131
00:04:35,038 --> 00:04:36,038
to those audiobooks, podcast, music.

132
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,320
And I always take a
Power bank or two with me

133
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:41,631
to keep my phone topped
up throughout the day.

134
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,290
Nothing worse than running out of battery.

135
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,270
Now, anytime you are stuffing
clothing in a suitcase

136
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,660
it's gonna get wrinkled.

137
00:04:49,515 --> 00:04:50,515
There's no way around it.

138
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,030
And that's why I always
travel with a steamer.

139
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:54,979
I never rely on my hotel to have one.

140
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
And if you've ever tried to
use an iron as a steamer,

141
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,438
you know it doesn't really work that well.

142
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,290
So that's why I always
make room to pack my own.

143
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,590
Another clothing maintenance tool

144
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,300
that I always travel
with is a clothing brush.

145
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,570
Helps me keep everything
lint and pet hair free

146
00:05:11,714 --> 00:05:12,714
as well as looking clean and new.

147
00:05:14,091 --> 00:05:15,091
And finally, we have a watch roll.

148
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:18,269
You guys know me.

149
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:19,446
I like to have options for the wrist

150
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,340
and for the variety of
things we're gonna be doing

151
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,470
from casual to formal,

152
00:05:23,822 --> 00:05:24,822
I'm definitely gonna need
more than just one watch.

153
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,270
Alright, so those are the basics.

154
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:29,712
Now I'm gonna quickly run
down my entire packing list

155
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
to include all the clothing, shoes,

156
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,750
and accessories I'll be bringing with me.

157
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm only gonna bring one coat with me

158
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:38,509
so it needs to be warm,
it needs to be versatile,

159
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
so I'm going with a
classic camel overcoat.

160
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,750
Next, brown plaid sport coat

161
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:45,370
and gray chalk striped flannel
suit for my tailored items.

162
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,690
Because it's winter,

163
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,970
I'm going heavy on cashmere sweaters.

164
00:05:49,848 --> 00:05:50,848
I've got a black turtleneck,
a cream turtleneck

165
00:05:52,776 --> 00:05:53,776
and a Navy V-neck.

166
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,450
Two shirts, a light blue button
up and a denim button down.

167
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
Three pairs of pants, mid gray flannel,

168
00:05:59,749 --> 00:06:00,749
blue jeans, and black jeans.

169
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,710
Since space is at a premium

170
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,450
I'm going with only two pairs of shoes,

171
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,940
formal and casual.

172
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,200
We've got brown oxfords
and white leather sneakers.

173
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,290
Onto accessories,

174
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:12,563
a tan knit hat, big brown scarf,

175
00:06:14,264 --> 00:06:15,264
a brown silk pattern tie,
white silk pocket square,

176
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
two white T-shirts,
two pairs of underwear,

177
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
two pairs of gray socks,
one pair of blue socks.

178
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,460
And for watches,

179
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,360
we're going with watch
number one on a mesh strap,

180
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:27,970
watch number two on a brown leather strap,

181
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:29,923
and a watch number three.

182
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,050
So that kind of seems like a lot,

183
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,180
but it really is the minimum that I need

184
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,880
for the range of things
that we'll be doing.

185
00:06:37,767 --> 00:06:38,767
And it also ensures that I'm not gonna be

186
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,050
wearing the same outfit more than once.

187
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
I'll show you how I'm gonna
pack everything in just a bit.

188
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,610
Trust me, it is going to fit.

189
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,440
But before I do that,

190
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,670
let me give you a rundown

191
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,690
of each individual outfit
that I'm going to be wearing.

192
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
So the first look here is the
outfit I'll be traveling in

193
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
from Baltimore up to New York.

194
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,490
We've got the camel
coat, black turtleneck,

195
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,770
paired with some medium
blue jeans, big brown scarf,

196
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,700
tan knit cap, white
sneakers, and the watch.

197
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,670
It's casual,

198
00:07:06,503 --> 00:07:07,503
but a nice mix of sporty and
tailored with the overcoat

199
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
and the sneakers.

200
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
But the most important thing
is that it's comfortable,

201
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:13,777
which is exactly what you
want when you're traveling.

202
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
Look number two is for
our evening out together

203
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,030
after we get in,

204
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
you can see that I've
repurposed the black turtleneck

205
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
that I wore on the way up and paired it

206
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,430
with a brown Glen plaid flannel sport coat

207
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,435
and some mid gray flannel pants.

208
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Anchoring this look are the brown Oxfords.

209
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
And on my wrist, we
have a beautiful watch.

210
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,730
Didn't wanna be too fancy,

211
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,930
but definitely wanted to
be elegant and refined,

212
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,930
so a turtleneck with a sport
coat is a great way to do that.

213
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
And of course camel
overcoat pairs effortlessly

214
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,269
with this look.

215
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,460
So for running around
the city the next day

216
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
doing a little shopping,

217
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
we're going with a slight variation

218
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
of the first travel look.

219
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Once again, the camel coat,

220
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
which I'm pairing

221
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:55,473
with the cream colored
cashmere turtleneck,

222
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:57,488
black jeans, white
sneakers, big brown scarf,

223
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,210
tan knit hat, and the watch.

224
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I feel like this look is very New York.

225
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,490
It's cool, it's a little edgy.

226
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:08,217
It also feels very simple
and effortless to me,

227
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,870
so really the perfect look for a morning

228
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
and possibly afternoon
running around the city.

229
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
I am a firm believer
that you really make your

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
own occasions to wear the
things that you want to wear.

231
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
And a fancy dinner with
friends in New York City

232
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,330
is the perfect opportunity to put

233
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
on my gray double breasted
chalk striped flannel suit.

234
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,220
I'm wearing it with a
light blue button up shirt

235
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,170
which I've paired with a brown
silk pattern tie to tie in,

236
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,380
seriously, no pun intended,

237
00:08:36,184 --> 00:08:37,184
with the dark brown Oxford shoes.

238
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,790
Dash of elegance in the breast pocket

239
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,530
with the silk pocket square

240
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:42,643
and as well as on the wrist.

241
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,310
Throw on the camel overcoat,

242
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
and I am ready to head to the restaurant

243
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,970
for a tasty cocktail, delicious dinner,

244
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
and great company.

245
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Look number five needs
to pull double duty,

246
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,550
because we're having a casual brunch

247
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,230
before we head to the train
station to travel back home.

248
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,290
So I'm going with a Navy V-neck layered

249
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,050
over a denim button down

250
00:09:02,187 --> 00:09:03,187
and paired with some medium
blue jeans, white sneakers,

251
00:09:04,862 --> 00:09:05,862
big brown scarf, and
the watch on the wrist.

252
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,670
Nothing fancy at all, just
casual and comfortable.

253
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:12,079
Great for an easy brunch and a two

254
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,140
and a half hour train ride back home.

255
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
Alright, so you've seen my essentials,

256
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,040
my entire packing list,

257
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:19,810
what each outfit looks like,

258
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,430
now it's time to pack it all up.

259
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,470
Alright, so first thing I'm gonna pack up

260
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
are my tailored items
beginning with my pants.

261
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:27,837
Now, the way I fold my
pants when I pack them

262
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,250
is to just fold them in half
once and then one more time,

263
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,050
so they're folded into quarters.

264
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,330
Next, the jackets.

265
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,650
Now the trick to folding a
sport coat or suit jacket

266
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,290
so it packs well is to basically turn one

267
00:09:42,765 --> 00:09:43,765
of the shoulders inside out.

268
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Then you nest the other
shoulder inside of that

269
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,430
make sure everything's lined up,

270
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,090
and then fold the jacket in half.

271
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:52,990
Now once again, the
shoulder goes inside out,

272
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,390
other shoulder nested inside that,

273
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,550
everything's lined up and folded in half.

274
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,190
These items go into the large packing cube

275
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:02,287
and I'm not gonna compress
it just to keep them

276
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:05,590
as wrinkle free as possible.

277
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,510
Shirts next.

278
00:10:07,343 --> 00:10:08,343
Now the first thing I do is
to button up most of the front

279
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
of the shirt, turn it over,

280
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,730
fold one sleeve over and
then bring the cuff up

281
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,610
to the collar.

282
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,660
Same thing with the other sleeve.

283
00:10:16,888 --> 00:10:17,888
Then I will fold the
shirt over into thirds

284
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:21,898
and into thirds one more time.

285
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,340
And that's how I fold the shirt.

286
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,510
So one more time here,

287
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,590
button up the front, flip it over,

288
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
fold each sleeve over,

289
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:29,639
and bring the cuff up to the
collar into thirds lengthwise,

290
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:33,322
and then into thirds one more time.

291
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,490
Next, I'm doing the sweaters.

292
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:37,690
Nothing fancy here,

293
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:38,698
just folding the sleeves under

294
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:41,290
and then folding the
sweater in half once more.

295
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,500
Then in this cube,

296
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,333
I'm also gonna put my jeans
and two white T-shirts.

297
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,430
All that goes into the cube, zip it up,

298
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
and compress to save some space.

299
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,030
Socks and underwear into the small cube,

300
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,405
zipped up, and compressed.

301
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:00,130
For my tie, I do have a travel
case that I like to use.

302
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,490
I'll fold the tie in half twice,

303
00:11:04,927 --> 00:11:05,927
put it into the case,

304
00:11:06,738 --> 00:11:07,738
buckle it in, and zip it up.

305
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
Toiletries next.

306
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,650
As I mentioned, using another cube,

307
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,750
instead of my regular dopp
kit to save space in my bag.

308
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,110
Now, the fun part of packing everything

309
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:20,170
into the carry-on.

310
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
On the left side,

311
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,240
that's where the large packing cube

312
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,130
with my tailored items goes,

313
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:25,648
I'm also going to put one shoe on the side

314
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,600
as well as the watch roll.

315
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,820
On the right side,

316
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,690
first the medium packing cube up there.

317
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:34,270
Then I'm going to lay the
tie case to the left of that.

318
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
Toiletries next,

319
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:38,950
followed by a second shoe.

320
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,660
Clothing brush goes here,

321
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,090
travel steamer goes here,

322
00:11:43,387 --> 00:11:44,387
and the cube with the socks
and underwear goes here.

323
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,950
Cinch that down.

324
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,270
Throw the power bank in right here

325
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
and the pocket square over here.

326
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,650
Then all I gotta do is
close it up, zip it up,

327
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:57,187
and I am ready to go.

328
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,190
And voila, there you have it.

329
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
I'm packed up.

330
00:12:02,093 --> 00:12:03,093
I'm ready to go.

331
00:12:02,926 --> 00:12:03,926
I actually really need to get outta here

332
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,500
to make it to the train,

333
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,333
but before I do,

334
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
I've got two things for you real quick.

335
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:08,950
First, of course wanna thank Audible

336
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,110
for sponsoring this video.

337
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,250
Reminder to go to audible.com/hespokestyle

338
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,130
or text hespokestyle, all one word,

339
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,530
to 500-500 to try
Audible free for 30 days.

340
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
And second,

341
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,233
if you want some more
winter outfit inspiration,

342
00:12:23,464 --> 00:12:24,464
got that playlist right
over there for you.

343
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:26,493
Click that,

344
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,326
there are eight videos
and whether you're looking

345
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
for suited looks, casual
looks, sweater looks,

346
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:31,930
or just some ways to
upgrade your winter style,

347
00:12:33,042 --> 00:12:34,042
that playlist will have
everything you need.

348
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,921
I'm outta here.

349
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:37,834
(lively music)
